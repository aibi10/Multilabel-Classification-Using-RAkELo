5373,7371,ana-all-nippon-airways,S Bajumi,United States,New revised economy's seating arrangement on ANA's 777-300 ER was a big disappointment. Flew on NH 0007 on May 18 continued on NH 835 on 787 on May 19 after 2.45 transit time. The first flight SFO-NRT was a miserable 10+ hours flight. I didn't expect to see 3x4x3 on a 77W seat plan especially from a 5 star airlines. Food was great and cabin crew were attentive but couldn't make up for the awkward seating arrangement. The second flight was on a 787 with a generous 2+4+2 it was a much better flight and I hope ANA will keep the seating arrangement on a 7+ hrs flight.,Economy,6,2,4,4,4,2,5,2015,0
4342,5870,airasia-x,Paesen Yves,Belgium,KUL-MELMEL-KUL check in good and fast friendly staff. Airbus 330-300 very clean with a lot of legroom friendly staff on board and food was not expensive. All flights on schedule.,Economy,10,5,5,4,0,5,11,2012,1
22935,35558,thomas-cook-airlines,P Phillips,United Kingdom,Just got back from Barbados on the (now) infamous TCX816 fight which was delayed a few times. We initially sat on the plane for 4hrs without going anywhere (not good) due to technical problems. Eventually got off the plane and taken to a hotel which was very nice. Thomas Cook did everything possible to make the transition smooth staff very helpful and polite. Should have left 6.30pm Thursday eventually left around 4pm Saturday. Would like to thank Thomas Cook for doing everything they could with efficiency and polite staff. My only criticism was having to hang about waiting for further updates every few hours had they said 24 plus hrs delay we could have enjoyed extra time on the beach instead of hotel room waiting for calls.,Premium Economy,9,4,5,4,3,5,11,2014,1
16573,24715,malaysia-airlines,D Tong,Indonesia,Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur on December 29 2014. The only 4 check-in counters open and I had to wait approx. 45 mins although only about 10 people queuing. The flight used a B737-800 and the crew were good. The magazines and newspapers were in a bad shape. The food were good (didn't get any options since they were running out of food). The luggage took another 45 minutes to come out.,Economy,6,4,2,5,5,4,1,2015,1
17543,26004,malaysia-airlines,Sam Wong,Malaysia,KUL-CDG on A380. The aircraft is nice and entertainment system was sufficient for the long flight. But the crews were terrible. Poor services throughout the flight not attentive to the needs of passengers and when requesting anything seemed reluctant to provide anything. No smiles from the crew. Definitely not a 5 star airlines with this kind of poor service.,Economy,1,3,1,1,3,1,9,2013,0

Have flown with Monarch many times from Luton airport the last trip we took as a couple was to Mahon which we found to be very good.

23218,35894,tap-portugal,A Griggs,United Kingdom,LHR-LIS-FAO return. All flights left about 10-30 minutes late yet the time was always made up in flight. Seats are quite comfortable and I would recommend row 24 on A321 as it is exit seat with extra room. Food served is average usually a cold sandwich apart for on LIS-LHR where due to a crew shortage no food or drinks could be served throughout the flight. TAP is a good option against the LCC when going to Europe as they offer competitive rates and include all meals and baggage. It must be said that their Lisbon hub is not the best due to the lack of signs and long walks between gates when transferring.,Economy,6,4,3,2,2,3,8,2012,1
23829,36657,transaero-airlines,J Kene,United Kingdom,Moscow to London. Economy and apart from no visual entertainment it was pretty good. I received champagne upon take off (in aid of Russian Christmas Eve). On my 4.5 hour flight I was offered non alcoholic and alcoholic refreshments another 5 times and then was brought tea and sparkling water. Staff were helpful and polite and the seats comfortable. The aircraft was aged but well maintained. I would definitely fly with no reservations flying with considering the price.,Economy,9,4,4,4,2,4,1,2012,1
2387,3142,air-canada-rouge,U Chatterton-Gilboe,Canada,Reserved and paid for regular Air Canada round trip Toronto to Puerto Vallarta last year for travel this April. Wound up on Rouge with a person with a dog in a carrier under the seat next to me. This left no space for the passenger's legs so he took part of my space which was tight enough already. When I politely asked for another seat I was told there were none. I walked the length of the plane and there were seats at the back. No entertainment tablets for $10 that did not work mushy sandwich and knees in my back. Thanks but no thanks - no more Air Canada for me. Rouge me once but not twice.,Economy,1,1,2,1,1,1,5,2014,0
870,1296,air-berlin,S Majid,Malaysia,Economy on ZRH-DUS and DUS-AUH. The planes were new but considering this is a European airline why did they design the seats with so little legroom? Everyone suffered when the the person in front started to recline seats. Limited choice on inflight entertainment. The experience on both flights were horrible and we would never want to fly with this airline again. Avoid this airline at all cost.,Economy,1,1,2,3,2,2,10,2014,0

22785,35367,thai-airways,Pistolesi Maurizio,Italy,Flew on the FCO-TPE route with B747 from Rome to BKK then A330-300 from BKK to TPE. FCO-BKK-FCO route Biz class only 30% seats were occupied crew very attentive friendly. Food very good hot towels 4-5 times. Seat on B747 in sleeping position very uncomfortable only recline approx.160 degree lack of legroom very difficult to sleep (I'm 192 cm). BKK-TPE route A330-300 seat very good IFE also very good. Service also very good even if biz. class almost full. On the last flight to FCO my bag was the 1st one on the carousel. I recommend Thai.,Business Class,7,2,4,4,3,4,1,2015,1
24039,37025,thomson-airways,K Fletcher-Biles,United Kingdom,I was dreading the Thomson flight from Gatwick to Sharm last week. The last time I flew on this route was on an old 757 with very cramped seats and no elbow room. My flight booking indicated that we would be on the same type of aircraft. What a surprise on boarding! A brand new 737-800 clean and fresh with almost decent legroom. The price is such that this is what should be supplied on this route it is no longer a cheap option to fly Thomson. There is no entertainment at all on a 5.5 hour flight not even recorded music. Thank god for i-pods. The bacon baguette was decent and the drinks not too expensive. The only niggle is that I often fly on full service carriers to Thailand (Twice the distance) with everything free and great in flight entertainment for only £100 more. Not only are the fares now much higher you are charged for baggage seat allocation food drink etc.,Economy,8,4,4,4,1,3,5,2013,1
25845,39298,virgin-atlantic-airways,D Day,United Kingdom,"LHR-ORD-LHR, VS39/VS40, UPPER CLASS. Heathrow Lounge best in the world. Cabin on A330 very tight on space. Food mediocre. Cabin crew outbound good. Return crew inattentive and rushed. Worst of all is the coffin like, herringbone, Upper Class seats. They are narrow and extremely uncomfortable. The saddest thing is that Virgin Atlantic used to be the best airline transatlantic. No longer, and they are not listening to their loyal customers. The overall product is average at best. They are still better than BA, but far behind the Middle East and Asian airlines.",Business Class,4,1,2,2,1,3,6,2015,1
22347,34740,tap-portugal,G Leach,United Kingdom,A very smooth and competent trip from Lisbon to London Gatwick. Nice to have bigger seats than Easyjet and a free sandwich/drink too!,Economy,10,5,5,4,2,5,10,2014,1
23534,36263,thomson-airways,A Marks,United Kingdom,Flew BRS - EFL on 29/05/2014 and return leg on 05/06/2014 on a 757-200. Positives first both flights on time and landed early cabin crew were polite and helpful and leg room was just about OK bearing in mind I'm 6ft 2in but for a 3.5 hour flight it was OK even with the window seat. The negative the plane was dirty on the inside and we were the first flight that plane had done one the way out no excuse really for Thomson apart from cutting corners with cleaning! Also the plane was very old now it works and got us there and back but was rather tatty in places and could do with a re-furb or replacement! Overall it was good like I said on time friendly staff just a bit dirty/grubby and old/tatty will use them again if the price is right!,Economy,8,3,5,3,0,4,6,2014,1
10609,15330,emirates,Foin Valery,Australia,I flew from Adelaide to Paris a couple of days ago. Having heard of the really good reputation of Emirates I was looking for to it. I was rapidly disappointed with a very basic service more than average food and their ICE entertainment system really not user friendly with a lack of movie choices. By experience there are far better airlines on offer for a better price too. Travelling back to Australia in a couple of weeks hopefully they will prove me wrong.,Economy,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2015,0
11162,15924,etihad-airways,Laurence McCarthy,Malaysia,"Have flown Etihad for many years. My last trip has made me somewhat less enthusiastic. Issues started when I went to KL Ticket Office to change my flights. They changed flights for GBP300 per seat, used to be GBP175 and told me I could no longer have a car from Heathrow to my home at the end of the journey. I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past. A re-think maybe, before Qatar Airways or Emirates (even BA) start to steal your premium passengers on this route.",Business Class,7,4,3,3,3,4,6,2015,1
11795,16627,etihad-airways,P Ervin,Egypt,BKK-AUH-CAI. Flight from BKK to AUH was on a Boeing 777 and excellent Pearl Business lay flat seats. Flight from AUH to CAI was a very old Airbus 319. Small plane cramped seating old and worn fabric. Recliners didn't really recline and the screen was in the armrest. Limited menu due to 4 hour flight time. Uncomfortable and ridiculous for the amount we paid.,Business Class,3,2,4,3,3,2,1,2014,0
11191,15957,ethiopian-airlines,Frank Rispin,Ethiopia,March 2014. Addis to London on Dreamliner. Had full breakfast in the best value cafe in Terminal 2 at Bole this is the one in the back row of shops not the London cafe. When I came out of there the queue for gate security had increased hugely but they came to the back looking for us London passengers and speeded us through. Flight left a little late but arrived early. This was the Monday daytime flight. Amazing views all the way including the Alps. Flew into Heathrow via superb views of Crystal Palace FC and Twickenham Stadium. Food and service first class.,Economy,10,4,5,5,1,4,6,2014,1
8066,11273,british-airways,R Thompson,Canada,Flew World Traveller Plus for the first time. Our trip was to and from LHR from Toronto YYZ. When flying a distance World Traveller Plus is well worth the little extra. Being a big guy - tall - I really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. And the on-board staff were super. Will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. Unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at Heathrow on Friday June 6th. We made it back to Toronto OK but our luggage was just delivered to our house today Wednesday June 11th. I guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. I'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. All-in-all I will definitely fly British Airways again.,Premium Economy,7,5,5,5,5,4,6,2014,1

14012,20181,interjet,Ashil Lunka,Mexico,Flew MEX-MID return just a week ago. Flight there went smoothly great jetBlue-like service with free snacks and drinks and friendly cabin crew. No seatback entertainment system (only dropdown screens) and the in-seat audio system didn't work at all but I didn't really mind since it was only a 1 hour flight. On flight back due to change of plans I ended up arriving at MEX much earlier than planned and to shorten the wait for the flight I asked for an earlier flight got one that departed 1 hour earlier at no additional charge (which may not be a plus as seen later in the story). Boarded the flight everything went just as well as before until approach to MID. Pilot comes on the radio and says that there will be a 10-15 minute delay because of weather. So the plane circles around a bit (in heavy turbulence I might add) and 20 minutes later the pilot comes over the radio and says that we're diverting to CUN. We diverted to CUN waited an hour on the ground and went back to MID. At MID I checked the board and the flight I was originally booked on had arrived on time. Thankfully I wasn't connecting or doing anything important but still. However I can't blame the airline for the weather and it's a good airline.,Economy,8,4,5,5,3,5,7,2014,1
18104,26960,oman-air,Simon Brown,United Kingdom,LHR-MCT-BKK return. Outbound ok. Decent seat pitch in economy and meals plentiful. Muscat has no airbridges so it's all bus transfers. MCT is a small airport with limited food and beverage facilities. Return leg delayed on departure from BKK meaning there was only 15 mins in MCT to get my connecting flight to LHR. Upon clearing Customs I was ushered to the gate for connecting flight. Reaching the aircraft we were told there would be a further delay as connecting flight from Katmandu was late. In the end we were 1.5 hrs late. Arrived in London 1.5 hrs late. All in all I cannot complain. AVOD is ok but not the latest releases. For the price vs service pretty good all round.,Economy,8,4,4,5,4,5,4,2012,1
17376,25725,lufthansa,G Howman,Qatar,DOH-FRA-YVR: Both legs of flight on A340 aircraft. Not my optimum choice of long-haul platform; however Lufthansa really made the best of things. Traveled economy both legs yet found that both seat space and leg room were more than adequate. Food was so-so and selection of movies average. However cabin crew were very attentive and customer oriented. This airline is becoming my airline of choice.,Economy,8,5,5,3,3,4,1,2014,1
11635,16466,eva-air,I Suttie,United Kingdom,I am a regular passenger on EVA Air flying from LHR-BKK-LHR in their Business Class. The recent changes from almost flat to full recline with their seating is a definite improvement. I sleep a little on these but never did on the older style seats. The cabin crew are always polite professional and friendly. The lounges at both LHR and at BKK are comfortable and serve a good selection of food and beverages. The aircraft's are clean and well equipped with amenities.,Business Class,10,5,5,4,5,5,7,2014,1
24779,38000,turkish-airlines,D Graubard,United States,FCO-IST-ADS-IST-BCN over a 4 day period early December. A320 or 737 aircraft - all in decent shape. Seat comfort is fine and on the 737s the leg room was larger then some premium economy flights I've been on. Where Turkish excels is the food - quality and quantity beat any airline hands-down and I've travelled on over a hundred airlines. Flight attendants were friendly and all spoke English well. On-time or within 10 minutes of schedule - Ataturk Airport is a mess and all flights arrived or departed via gate stand so dealing with buses to and from the planes gets annoying. Overall for the money paid Turkish gives a good product. Again - as stated by many people- they keep their planes too warm. I wouldn't fly them on anything longer then 4 hours.,Economy,9,4,4,5,3,4,12,2013,1
20963,31647,south-african-airways,Derek Salter,South Africa,Travelled economy between Cape Town and New York via Johannesburg. The flight to New York is one of the longest in the world - 15.5hrs. But it went by quickly and smoothly. The staff were extremely helpful provided two main meals and regular snacks and water. The seat was comfortable with good leg room. Highly recommended. Immigration in NYC Terminal 4 has improved a lot and was very quick especially if you are a regular visitor. At Jo'burg on return no lines and through to collect baggage quickly. Flight entertainment varied good size screens but some were faulty at times and system had to be re-booted occasionally. Toilet facilities kept very clean.,Economy,9,5,5,5,4,5,4,2015,1
2913,3871,air-france,R Donnelly,United States,We flew from Atlanta to Paris. From the minute we entered the international terminal in Atlanta GA to the minute we left Paris on an Air Austria flight bound for Vienna I have nothing but wonderful things to say about AF. The staff in Atlanta went beyond their job description to make our check in and transition to the jet as perfect as it could be. Yes the food isn't gourmet but it was hot tasty and filling. We had a decent Merlot and our stewardess served us each 2 little bottles of VSOP Cognac. The cabin was clean and comfortable. A great selection of movies. There was more leg room than on domestic flights. Service was kind and considerate. The cabin was darkened and it was quiet and easy to rest. We were served a basic fruit/coffee/muffin breakfast nothing fancy but it was OK. All in all the best thing about AF is the people.,Economy,10,4,5,3,5,5,5,2014,1
4101,5516,airasia-x,P Elliott,Australia,March 2014 Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur and from KL down to Perth a week later. Air Asia has had a number of excellent promo fares. In general $200 out of Australia and $100 into Australia. We paid $15 for seat reservation in the quiet child-free cabin. That was an excellent choice as the cabin is kept for people who booked seats in it. The curtains are drawn and the staff police it from anyone wandering in. On the Adelaide - KL sector we got a middle seat free. On the KL - Perth sector we could spread out on 3 seats each. I wouldn't bother with a premium seat unless on a night flight. We took extra food and our tablets loaded with entertainment. The meals we pre- ordered were ok. The flights went smoothly and we arrived early each time. There's an in-flight magazine in the seat back and you can always watch the stewardesses. Their uniform is world famous. The low cost terminal in KL is a shocker so you need to put on your blinkers and deal with it. There's banks a duty free shop water to drink and toilets. The new low cost terminal will open soon and it looks wonderful. We pre-purchased a SIM card and that was ready and waiting on arrival before the duty free shop so I could make calls immediately. Taxi vouchers are sold after luggage collection. And within an hour you are at your KL hotel. The departure to Perth was of a morning so we stayed at the Tune hotel near the terminal. So it was easy to make the early flight. Oh I did online check-in for both flights. Baggage drop was quick and easy. I didn't pay any attention to the offers from Optiontown as the Air Asia X product is ok. We'll be happy to use Air Asia X again any time in future.,Economy,10,4,5,4,0,5,3,2014,1
2991,3977,air-india,Sean Singh,Singapore,AI 102 from JFK to DEL on their non stop service. I would rate the trip to be completely satisfactory. Comfort - This is what the trip is about. Kudos to AI team for having their Boeing 777-300ER to be configured as 3-3-3 seating instead of 3-4-3 seating which many airlines do this translates to excellent seat space and good leg room. The trip has perfect timings and usually reaches Delhi well ahead of schedule. Food - Being from Indian origin I liked the food which is hot and a little spicy. Entertainment - Now many would want a great entertainment units for this flight and even would have made plans to watch a lot of things inflight well don't this flight is great to sleep and rest. The movie selection was not great and their interface needs improvement Crew - Now there are a lot of small things that make an airline great and I do tend to see them from the captain speaking about the journey and enthusiasm of the crew with a big smile each time they serve. Transfer at Delhi was fast and breezy. Overall even though there are a few shortcomings I would recommend this flight.,Economy,8,5,4,4,3,5,4,2014,1
5512,7572,ana-all-nippon-airways,A Leibiebowitz,United States,PVG-NRT-JFK Shanghai-Tokyo-New York 6/5/2014: Both flights on 773 one older livery and one new both 3 class. I was originally booked for business class my husband was supposed to be as well however after a screw up by our travel agent he found himself in economy. Although I did not cause a disturbance at the counter I guess my face showed my disappointment at the incompetence of our travel agent. To my surprise the woman checking us in bumped me to first for the first leg of our flight because they couldn't help my husband at that point. Upon our arrival at NRT before disembarking there was an announcement for my husband to see a cabin attendant. They found a seat for him in premium economy NRT-JFK with no extra charge. My husband reported that economy service and entertainment options were very good and the seats were comfortable. I briefly checked out the lounges as I did not want to abandon my husband for too long. Lounges had a good selection of food table service bar changing room etc. In-flight the attendants are what you expect from Japanese service including bowing in multiples. I had a chance to enjoy a full Japanese meal and a Western meal both near excellent the Japanese meal edged ahead for presentation. The entertainment system was not the best I have experienced but it was very good and there are plenty of English and Japanese movies and programing to choose from. The staggered seats are comfortable I have no real problem with the foot cubby. I was pleased to find each seat had an additional cushion which unfolded for making the lie-flat seats even and more comfortable for sleeping. I used it the whole flight even when sitting up. I recommend choosing a seat with the side-table on the aisle they are more private. The check-in and in-flight crew on ANA is one of the most attentive and gracious I have ever come across. In my experience ANA's rating is well deserved.,Business Class,10,4,5,5,4,5,6,2014,1
16426,24532,malaysia-airlines,Peter Moran,Australia,Reasonable Business Class Product but economy is not as god as other full service airlines. Flew BKK-KUL economy KUL-SYD Business and SYD-KUL-BKK economy. Business was due.to an MH Upgrade bid being accepted. I found the staff in business were friendly and proactive but in economy they can be surly and do not go out of their way at all to be of assistance. Golden Lounge in KUL was large but the food selection was limited despite Malaysia having some excellent dishes. On board the satay was excellent but my chef on call meal was accompanied by very hard vegetables. Dessert had no choice and was not exciting. Wine choice was excellent. The seat is better than economy but the angle made me feel like I always had to prop myself up so thank goodness for the footrest. Economy food was lacklustre and the wine is just palatable. Service not happy no menus and it took more than an hour for drinks to be served on a two hour flight. I did not see the staff come through with water or other drinks once. IFE is OK but it takes some time to get going and the collect the headphones a long time before landing and then show arrival videos. OK for a first time flyer but annoying for more frequent travellers. Overall it was safe online check in 48 hours before flight is good safety not an issue. MH just needs to elevate staff attitudes and encourage a bit more friendliness and the perception of their product will improve even if the hard product does not. Good prices make MH a decent choice but they are not as good as other one world carriers.,Economy,5,3,2,2,3,4,3,2015,1

25444,38820,united-airlines,Galimidi Yves,Belgium,Nightmare with United last week. I had a 1st class ticket Miami-Chicago on UA and Chicago-Zurich-Brussels on Swiss 3 flights on one ticket. Connecting time in Chicago 3 hours and 25 minutes. Checked-in in Miami for my UA flight and Y flight was delayed several times. Finally the plane landed. Ready for boarding and then technical failure was announced. Staff did not know if and when the plane would leave. I explained my situation and asked to be rebooked on another airline any airline in order to leave Miami since I was supposed to have a knee surgery upon my return in Brussels. UA staff refused and were not polite at all. Finally at 8pm announcement that our flight was cancelled. I had spent nearly 7 hours at that airport. I was granted a room at the Holiday Inn airport which was fine and then food vouchers at the same hotel. In total 21 USD for lunch/dinner/breakfast. One thing is for sure never again United. I was rebooked on the day after Miami/Newark/Brussels on the day after first class domestic business class long-haul. Ok but far from the Swiss service standards.,First Class,1,3,1,2,3,3,5,2014,0
7657,10782,british-airways,S Shailes,United Kingdom,BA213 Heathrow to Boston 29/09/14 B747. There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,1,10,2014,0
15081,22548,klm-royal-dutch-airlines,R Simon,Austria,VIE-AMS-DFW on Aug 8 VIE-AMS on a 737-700 AMS-DFW on an old Airbus 330-200 both legs in Business Europe / World Business Class – VIE-AMS was on time FAs were friendly and attentive continental breakfast served was decent although not stellar as with most flight in Europe seats were economy seats with the middle seat left vacant. – AMS-DFW on-time on a tired but clean Airbus 330-200 with vintage 2-2-2 configuration. IFE was AVOD but screens were from previous century and picture quality poor selection was OK. WBC seats were just angle-flat and rather tired but comfortable for resting on a day flight. FAs were brilliant attentive and doing their job with a smile. Food served was quite good. Salmon Tartare and Indonesian Chicken Curry (or 2 other choices of Beef or Plaice) for lunch. Chili Prawns and Indonesian Beef (or Cod) for the second meal. It was nice that the product featured some Dutch (Indonesian) elements throughout the flight and was not just generic. Wines served were also nice with some interesting choices not just the standard fare. KL uses a shared airport lounge in VIE which is not particularly great but in line with other lounges in VIE and at least not overcrowded. KL’s Non-Schengen lounge in AMS was nice and spacious with a decent selection of drinks but with limited food choices. Transfer in AMS involved walking long distances but was otherwise hassle free. Overall I found KL to offer a good product for a day flight thanks to the soft product on board and the flights' on-time performance. Recommended for a day flight in spite of the old planes used on this particular transatlantic route.,Business Class,8,3,5,5,3,3,10,2014,1
11,11,adria-airways,Hashim Azlan,Malaysia,I was on JP650 the evening departure to Istanbul on 28th August. It was on a very clean Airbus A319 and it was a light load flight. The crew were warm and kind especially the Purser who took her time walked and talked to several passengers. They even offered me a pillow and blanket which I appreciated. A warm refreshment with selections of cold/hot beverage were offered on this 2 hours flight. We took off about 5 minutes earlier and landed more or less 20 minutes earlier. It was a relaxing flight and I do hope they will be flying to more destinations in the future since Slovenia is a beautiful and lovely country to visit.,Economy,7,4,5,3,3,5,8,2013,1
4521,6155,air-transat,P Smith,United Kingdom,Took a Christmas flight from London to Vancouver. This is the second time I have flown with the airline. I travelled on a newly refurb plan. I travelled with my family and we had a baby and paid additional money for the bassinet seat at the front. I really can't say one nice thing about this flight. The lighting is awful fluorescent mood lighting which appear not to work and was directly over the bassinet no method to dim. Seat arms are solid and could not be lifted up (unique to the front row middle) which is crazy. In addition all the galleys have been removed so there is one at the front and back with just row after row of seats. I fly a lot long haul and typically you have some space to stretch your legs or stand around. Not with this config. Food - rubber pasta with cheese sauce - this was not even edible. One positive point is they are cheap you do get what you pay for.,Economy,3,1,2,1,0,3,3,2013,0

Fortunately this was paid for by the people who invited me to lecture in Brasilia because if I had been paying I would not have been happy. The seating arrangements were reasonable but the service was poor at best and the food was sub-economy standard on most airlines. The poor service include having to ask for most things and not being offered anything (like drinks) more than once several mistakes on the breakfast order non-availability of several food items on the menus generally morose staff etc etc. This was really poor TAM - you are letting your country down and you need to get your act together with the Olympics looming fast!,Business Class,2,3,1,1,4,2,5,2015,0

274,355,aer-lingus,C Macon,Ireland,Firstly do not be tempted to sit in seats 31 E D F G or 29 A C H I on the Dublin to Boston route the Aer Lingus website will not show that these seats do not recline. I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned. Overall the whole experience was so poor I would much rather go with an airline that actually wants to give passengers a reasonable experience even if it takes a few hours longer to get to my destination.,Economy,2,1,4,1,3,3,8,2014,0
26590,40195,volaris,L Zarate,United States,Unacceptable experience in May on an LAX to Guadalajara flight. Chose Volaris because they had the lowest price. However their strange new luggage policies negated any financial savings. You don't get to bring as many lbs onboard as with other airlines and they are incredibly strict about this requirement. We had 2 checked bags and 2 pieces of carry-on luggage which they insisted we re-balance until all 4 weighed exactly the same. They don't let you do this at the counter so you have to get out of line and open your bags in the back of the terminal move things around and then stand in line again. It took us 4 tries and 1.5 hours to actually check in the 2 bags and we barely had time to make it to the gate and board. Considering all 4 bags flew on the same airplane it obviously wasn't a question of excess weight. When I priced return trip tickets the additional baggage charges made their rates completely uncompetitive and low prices were the only reason we had for flying Volaris.,Economy,1,4,3,3,2,2,7,2013,1

11552,16382,eva-air,William MacCormac,United Kingdom,I've flown EVA regularly over the last 2 years - premium economy for this last flight. Only relatively good value nowadays as other carriers are getting closer. Space on Elite class. 30% more money gets slightly wider seat and decent leg room. The downside is the seat pitch isn't that great in my opinion. Just a couple of degrees more would make a huge difference to sleep quality. Food and Drink. This was the real weak point of EVA until recently. Things are a little better. Inflight entertainment. Film selection is ok but not so good is the music. It doesn't change enough and really isn't that good for western tastes. Journey. Keeping the temperature above freezing this time was a relief! And being a night flight to BKK is great and getting back to LHR in the evening is also good. My biggest gripe? The passengers who open the window blinds (when its light outside) and ruin everyone's sleep. When the cabin goes dark the blinds should all stay firmly down.

Both flights ran on time and were comfortable. Food was fine and service was good - cabin crew came through often and were attentive. They give the kids a goodie bag which kept them amused. If you travel with kids under 12 sign up for the kids club (free). They get priority check-in boarding snack vouchers priority luggage etc. Finally a perk to travelling with kids! Only complaint was that we didn't get the new cabin interiors on either flights which meant no individual TV screens but I see they are on a 2 year plan to complete this by 2014. I would use them again if their prices were competitive to the big carriers.,Economy,8,4,4,4,3,5,7,2013,1

So when I turned up at Sydney airport for my return flight at 12 midday I assumed I'd be able to change to an earlier flight than my existing 5pm. But no all flights were fully booked so I had to wait at the airport for 5 hours. Was a waste of money buying a flexible ticket. They had spare seats in business class but would not let me have one.

Short haul flights were comfortable and smooth light meal served and seating is the typical 3 in a row with the middle one kept clear. The long haul VIE-BKK flight was on the new lie flat business seats. They were comfortable and the screen for entertainment very good clear sharp but a limited selection of films. The Sky Chef is a really nice touch and food was good - a really tender steak. Crew are generally reserved - but as a Star Alliance gold member I was personally greeted which is a nice touch. My reservations are basically two. The first is seating reservations. On both legs I pre booked a single seat but got put in both cases onto a pair - with the second seat empty. I thought Gold would have given me priority but it seems the Senator Gold was higher- fair enough but worth noting in future. The second was the space in the seats. On the return leg I had 8A (777-200 config) which was fine but outboard I had 10K - right up against economy and with a tight space to 10H - a real squeeze to get in and out.

7443,10513,british-airways,M Gibson,United Kingdom,MAN-LHR-LAX. Flew Manchester to LAX via Heathrow on Christmas day in Club World on the A380. Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.,Business Class,6,5,2,4,5,3,1,2015,1

I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years.

Really on a trip this length a 5 star airline should have lay flat seats. Also the AVOD was poor with movies only available on a loop viewed on a grainy screen. How can an airline be rated 5 star without on demand video on a reasonable screen?

London ground agents booked our seats not just to Seoul but Sydney as well, and our bags were automatically transferred by the airline to our Sydney plane as there was no layover. This gave us more time to relax in the lounge. Onboard experience was fantastic. Three out of the four legs had excellent flat beds and only the Sydney to Seoul leg had angled seats which were great for a day flight but I'd question its comfort overnight. What was truly memorable was the gracious and respectful cabin service on every single flight. The crew seemed like they weren't just great attendants but great people in general.

The seats were comfy (if a bit old) the duvet and large pillow really helped you get some sleep the inflight entertainment was good and the service excellent. Entry into the business class lounges in Melbourne / Brunei Dubai and London was part of the ticket and made a difference.

I arrived at the Air Canada check-in in pain and shock. I was greeted by the most caring and compassionate ticket agent who immediately called the medics. They got a wheelchair and ice packs for my face and accompanied me through customs after clearing me for travel with the on call doctor. They gave me extra ice packs for the flight to Toronto and the flight attendants gave me a bag of ice to rest my face in and constantly checked back to check my comfort.

The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge.

Flight back on an A340 with dreadful inflight entertainment from the stone age. The crew were good on both flights kept us supplied with water and orange juice. My only real complaint was the food! Not expecting gourmet in cattle truck class but the food really is dreadful. The food out was passable (just) but the return leg from Chicago was inedible. Bread rolls that resembled a pet rock a lump of gristle the menu said was beef and breakfast was some lump of coloured sugar called a breakfast bap another lump of sugar called oat bar and a frozen lump of sugar called orange juice.

This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it.

Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago.

The next day's flight from B.A. to Sao Paulo was also delayed, with at first no annoucement at all (we had already boarded), then very late an announcement with differing details in Portuguese, Spanish and English, then an announcement that we would be offloading some passengers to re-book which turned out to be correct. Very chaotic, and the crew disappeared during this time. Finally I did make my final connection, and on this one (the 12-hour flight), my entertainment system didn't work, this included my call button, so I couldn't even get assistance and the crew didn't bring around drinks once during the entire flight (except with the 2 meal services).

We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days.

PROS: First Class check-in due to my One World Emerald Tier status; Flights on time except for DFW-SEA that left the gate on time but returned due to a mechanical problem that resulted in a delayed departure of an hour and arrival in SEA 40 minutes late. All planes clean and either new or fairly new. Staff efficient and most were quite friendly except for one on the SEA-DFW segment who had an attitude problem. Snacks for sale on three of the four segments and complimentary beverages served on all segments seats comfortable except for DCA-DFW (see CONS). Baggage transferred efficiently and delivered on the carousels at SEA and IAD very quickly as they had One World priority tags. CONS: The Admiral's Club Lounges look nice with comfortable seats but the free snack offerings at DFW were pitiful DCA-DFW had a brand new plane with the new B737 sky interior and AA leather seats. This was outstanding though sadly ruined by two awful boxes for the seat back video screens anchored on both sides of the middle seat foot well. This was pathetic for legroom on even a three-hour flight; Any airline that can find a very compact version of this video control box is a winner! Overall despite the many negative reviews that I have read recently about AA I was very satisfied with this trip and will definitely use them again.

We had the usual inconsiderate passengers in front of us who reclined their seats as far back as possible so we had minimal room. Do not bother to pay this extra. It is not worth it. The food was average. The drinks were plentiful and free. The flight was smooth and baggage claim at Manchester reasonable.,Economy,5,2,4,3,3,3,6,2014,0

8757,12049,china-airlines,Dennis Blank,United States,Flew Sep 2013 LAX-PEK-BKK. I’d chosen Air China strictly on price and was a little apprehensive. However everything from check-in on was up to international travel standards. The flight was no better or worse than other transpacific trips I'd taken in recent years on more highly regarded carriers. Food was OK and in-flight service was just fine. The coach seats were considerably more comfy than those on the Cathay Pacific flight I'd taken a year earlier. Because it is very geared to Chinese travelers I could see why someone might find the in-flight entertainment lacking. Available English language movie selection was a bit dated and odd and included a fair number of Westerns from the 50’s and 60’s. While flying CA is not bad at all transiting in the Beijing airport is another matter entirely. Before proceeding on to the connecting flight we queued up in a pretty long line for the thinly staffed Chinese immigration desk to stamp us into China. We were then channelled into the airports general security line for re-entry into the airports departure gate area. Very frustrating and very time consuming. I'd be reluctant to take any flight where there is a transfer in PEK. If you have a tight connection you are not going to make it. Bottom line: if the ticket price is attractive and there was ample time between connecting flights in PEK I would not hesitate to fly CA again.,Economy,8,4,5,4,3,4,3,2014,1

8233,11440,british-airways,R Richards,United Kingdom,LGW-Antigua on 29 April and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It started off badly when I went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 February. The system rejected both my credit and debit cards. On checking the state of my account with BA online I found that the final payment had been credited to my account and I now owed the initial deposit. I sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. First call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of English. Another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. I was told it had been sorted out and received E ticket email with my state of account showing I owed nothing. Two weeks later I received another E ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. Next credit card statement did not show money taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. Two weeks before flight I got a phone call from BA stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. I then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. About 22 hours before flight I went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. Arrived at LGW to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. We then had to queue to drop off baggage. Other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. Flight left and arrived on time. However the inflight main meal was the worst I have ever experienced on an aircraft. There was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. The inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to Singapore in 1962 was better. On return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. Check in at Antigua was one of the quickest check ins I have ever done. Left Antigua on time and arrived LGW on time. Food was worse than going out. No choice. Starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. Main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. White wine was just about drinkable. Coffee served as we started main course. Asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty.

I had loaded some films onto my Ipad so the IFE not working (depended on the seat) I wasn't bothered at all. The seats were comfortable and the staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. They were particularly kind to my daughter who was worried with the turbulence. The food served was excellent on both legs of the journey.

Economy seating quite spacious in an A319 and surprising amount of legroom. Food and drinks are for purchase however the choice offered and the quality proposed is largely worth the expense. Flight arrived with a 20 minute delay however the disembarking process went on quickly. As always at BRU bags tend to take some time to arrive but the labyrinth that gets you there does somehow reduce the sense of wait. Return flight even better.

The staff at SGN was nice though I had no idea why he was so slow in re-checking for my information as I had checked-in online previously. By the way they dedicated a counter for check-in online passengers but it was unhelpful. And worse the staffs at HAN check-in counters were rude like I was begging them something. VN used A330 and B777 for my flights which were good a bit comfortable. The stewardess' English was terrible though. Food was so disappointed to me with a cold thick sandwich.

8719,12009,china-eastern-airlines,Tom Shearer,Australia,"Shanghai to Melbourne on 16 December 2014. There was an inadequate announcement of safety protocols and the laminated leaflet was inadequate. The cabin was dingy from the 1970s and not cleaned thoroughly - there was rubbish from the previous flight(s) both on the floor and in the seat folio. The entertainment system was appalling. The selection of movies did not include any current releases. The ""nostalgia"" section contained not one but two Shirley Temple films. The screen image and subtitles were shadowy and blurred and the sound quality was very poor. No drinks were provided after take off. After 95 minutes I asked a flight attendant if I might have some water. The request was met with a surly look and the flight attendant said that drinks would be served with the meal service in 20 minutes. I asked the flight attendant for water again and after 15 minutes a plastic cup half filled was produced. Things got worse. Children were permitted to use the cabin as an activity area and continually ran along aisles shouting and squealing. The meal was lukewarm. The dinner roll was at least two days old the savoury roll at least three. The chicken dish was tepid and the rice came in a rectangular non friable block apparently not heated. Dessert was a canned peach half and pear quarter. There was no fresh fruit nor vegetables. A third glass of wine was offered - the polite question ""could I have a little more?"" was met with stony indifference. The coffee like the cabin was from the 1970s.",Economy,1,2,1,1,1,1,12,2014,0

I was told UA does overbooking in all classes. I was looking forward to this flight enroute in First Class as I was connecting to BKK hence I wanted to relax. Alas I wasn't able to relax as I had to ask UA team for every 10 minutes for an update. Finally after a long argument with the gate staff I was given a a First Class seat by an arrogant lady who made one feel that she did me a great favor although it was within my right.

26504,40061,virgin-atlantic-airways,K Russell,Canada,"I flew out of YVR to LHR two weeks ago. Being a nervous flyer I always hate flying and reading the recent reviews I was even more nervous to fly with Virgin! At the check-in desk however my worries began to be lessened. One of the Virgin Flight check-in staff listened as I told him I was nervous about flying and helped find my children and I a seat in the bulkhead. At the gate the staff allowed ""people who need a little more time to board"" on first and we settled easily into VS96 on that night a really modern looking plane. Couldn't fault it - it looked clean and colourful. The flight itself was smooth and even though the air stewards were not perhaps as proactive as on British Airways when I asked for help with getting a drink for the kids or something along those lines they helped straight away and without complaint. The only less than stellar thing was the kids' meal - which looked like the adult version of a meal but it was a late flight and the kids had already eaten so I didn't care too much about that and neither did they. No kids flight pack either - but to be honest that didn't bother me either - less junk to carry around post flight. When the plane landed 9 hours later at LHR my son had an epic meltdown. One of the Virgin Angels came out and asked if I needed a hand with my bags (I had one child under each arm and was kicking my bag along with my foot): I gladly took her up on her offer and she accompanied us all the way to customs bless her chatting all of the way.

Security agent refused to let me go into check in although I pledged I was flying with Thai. A security supervisor came and intervened and I was allowed to the check in counter. Once at check-in it took the agent over 30 minutes to process! She then refused to give me the boarding pass as she said she could not locate my return ticket. I told her this is because it was a separate ticket to Vietnam and I showed her the e-ticket stored in the phone. It then took her over 10 minutes to clear with somebody on the phone. Once on board the 777 it was usual Thai friendliness and quality. My seat and my neighbour's failed after take off. Cabin crew did not bother fixing it and just asked us to move to other seats as there were plenty empty seats. The television in the 2nd seat did not work and I was moved to yet another seat. Transfer in Bangkok smooth but TG Domestic lounge facilities were basic. BKK-HKT short but the cabin crew managed to serve food and very friendly as well. It is comfortable but all facilities on board or on the ground seem to be old and worn.,Business Class,7,3,3,5,3,5,4,2013,1
11410,16189,ethiopian-airlines,G Slade,United Kingdom,Flew Business Class from Kinshasa to Addis Ababa and onto Bangkok. I have had better quality entertainment and food on Economy Flights of other airlines. The inflight entertainment was a shared TV and showed one awful movie. On my flight to Bangkok which was an 8 hour flight we had one awful meal in total and even though we arrived at 8 in the morning we got no breakfast not even a cup of tea/coffee! It's very unfortunate that I have to return back using the same airline as the ticket has already been purchased but I will never use them again.,Business Class,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,2012,0

Had bassinet seat or if not available were given the extra legroom seat free of charge. On aircraft staff were also helpful/friendly particularly with our baby's needs (water bottle cleaning etc). Food was generally decent quality and enjoyable but they now seem to have economised by giving you a dessert after the main service - but doing so by not giving you one with your main! Gates are generally good aside from the huge distance from shops to gate at LHR T3 - must be nearly a mile?,Economy,7,3,4,3,4,3,1,2014,1
22978,35618,thai-airways,E Crummy,Australia,We went from Sydney to Bangkok then Bangkok to Phuket and return. Food was just passable. Service really needs work. Pressed the attendant buzzer and was walked past a number of times. Not even asked if we would like wine with our dinner and were squashed in I doubt I would use this airline again. The only good thing were that the flights were on time.,Economy,3,1,1,1,4,1,4,2014,0

13781,19807,icelandair,George Burdell,United States,Overnight to Sweden and back March 2014. Changing planes in Iceland makes for a shorter trip to Europe. The seats were very hard. No meals on an overnight flight was a shock. Iceland airport is fairly small so getting through customs and to the connecting flight was easy and quick. With SAS reducing flights Icelandair is a reasonable alternative. But bring your own sandwich and seat cushion.,Economy,6,1,5,2,4,4,3,2014,1
4299,5812,airasia-x,Zailani Atiqah,Malaysia,Took an Air Asia X flight to Japan. Flight arrived early and the staff were very helpful.

Check in procedures were fast on both flights with dedicated desk for business first and senator/hon members. Good business lounge in Boston. Flat seats on both flights.

Rebooking agent was rude. Worse I know these cancellations are a matter of routine - same happened to two relatives in May. Finnair apparently cancels flights when they do not sell a minimum number of tickets. I fly 60K miles a year but will never ever fly them again.

11810,16643,etihad-airways,L Duffy,United Kingdom,Chengdu China to Manchester UK on 29th December. Now the service on the flight from Abu Dhabi was nothing to sing and dance about a busy flight with every seat booked out and cabin crew just scrambling about to keep everyone fed and watered. They did remember my special meal but it was an odd breakfast combination but this is the only reason food and beverages did not get five stars from me. Chengdu to Abu Dhabi: While the ground crew at Chengdu were clueless the cabin crew on this flight were excellent. Attentive and interested in the well being of passengers they conducted regular cabin walks and brought water every hour to passengers in economy. They even conducted a chocolate run going through the cabin during the night to see if anyone watching films or reading would like individual chocolates with another drink. On landing they were helping get baggage down and giving directions for first timers to Abu Dhabi about gates.,Economy,9,4,4,4,5,5,1,2014,1
12009,16902,fiji-airways,Henderson Roderick,United Kingdom,LAX-Nadi / Nadi-LAX. 787 seats are poor-too narrow and uncomfortable for such a long flight. Cabin Staff OK but not particularly friendly particularly in comparison with local Fijians. Once food and Beverage service is completed they disappear. Main gripe is the food- simply nowhere near good enough in this competitive market. FA really need to improve the F&B offering. Whoever suggested that breakfast should comprise a so-called omelette with all the flavour and consistency of Styrofoam accompanied by curried carrots?,Economy,5,2,3,1,3,4,3,2015,1
11505,16325,etihad-airways,S Martin,Australia,Flew SYD-AUH-GRU-AUH-SYD. My SYD-AUH flight was operated by Virgin Australia and was an excellent experience that I will not comment on here. The other three flights were operated by Etihad which were fine enough. AUH-GRU and return was on an A340 - the planes felt a little old but there was plenty of space compared to most economy seats I've been in. However AUH-SYD was on a B777 with quite possibly the worst economy long-haul seat I've experienced. The plane was nice and new and the IFE was excellent but the 3-4-3 layout meant the seat width was very narrow and uncomfortable even for a skinny guy like myself. It was hard to walk up and down the aisles to get to the bathrooms due to lack of space - kept bumping into people and I'm glad I wasn't sitting in an aisle seat otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed by this. Virgin Australia use a 3-3-3 layout on the exact same plane and it was very comfortable. Etihad need to learn something from their partner.,Economy,7,2,3,3,5,4,7,2014,1

Lots of people lost their connection in CDG. The flight was excellent, service was great with excellent food and beverage. The Videos were the same as KLM in MAY, as I flew to IAD by KL.

They operate smaller planes although the Embraer 190 is decent enough. 2x2 seating with reasonable overhead lockers. Seat is adequate (much more leg room than an AF 777 in economy and probably a little wider) for a 2.5 hours flight. In both cases the crew did the job professionally although the service in economy is limited to a drink and some biscuits. On return was upgraded to ""Premium"" which is not much different (same seat) but includes a decent cold light meal and Champagne. Left on time and arrived on time both ways. it seems however that heating / A/C is diffcult to manage on all Embraer 19X planes every time I take one it is much too hot in the middle despite crew efforts. Globally a very decent performance.

5718,7829,american-airlines,N Smith,United States,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products).

Dreading this flight due to the seats on the outward flight so I will deal with this first what a difference this seat was 56A (VNA149) much better support and a foot rest so the gamble is the plane you are flying on. IFE worked but dated and limited due to films on the outward leg (feedback from children). Crew were again very good and attentive and food (why do you get offered a meal at 2 am how about a snack and a decent breakfast) was good although ran out of my choice but the alternative Viet breakfast was excellent. A passenger emergency was handled very well on the flight. All in all I feel for VN they have been let down hugely by the late delivery of the new Boeing 787 and we the customer have suffered. I will gladly look forward to flying them again and if all is well on a new plane with a service that I feel will be up with the likes of SAA and Emirates.,Economy,8,3,4,4,3,4,8,2014,1

Crew polite and attentive but rushed service due to the short length of flight and stormy weather and turbulence. Zurich-Berlin Tegel on an A320 3x3 with the middle seat empty not a fan of this euro-configuration for business. Flight delayed almost an hour in Zurich due to severe storm and airport congestion. For the 1.10 hrs flight a full dinner was served in spite of the heavy rain and turbulence with fresh breads foie-gras and sauerkraut Swiss cheeses and a fruits-tart for dessert.

Very nice and efficient cabin crew. Long transfer at IST Ataturk Airport. For such a reason Turkish paid a very nice hotel for me (5 stars) located in the city center. Free transfers also provided both ways. Istanbul-Sao Paulo: 13 hours daily flight aboard a new 773-full flight. I got the emergency exit which means a lot of space for a better rest. The 3-3-3 seat configuration in Economy is extremely appreciated and TK is one of the few airlines world-wide which still keeps it nowadays. Very young and pleasant cabin crew. Meals: overall two hot meals - tasty and well-presented. IFE completed with a wide range of movies and TV programs. Live TV and free-wifi onboard definitely a plus.

Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though.

15747,23386,korean-air,C Hazelford,Taiwan,I feel Korean Air is lagging behind other airlines in east Asia. Although their service was fair it was not what I expected in Business Class. The aircraft from Taipei to Seoul was modern and comfortable. The staff were very gracious and polite. However from Seoul to Toronto the aircraft was tired and worn and the cabin itself was not terribly clean. The toilets were kept spotless but Business class wasn't terribly full. The seats were not lay flat seats and the seats seemed a little worn. Somewhere over the Pacific my entertainment system failed and although they staff very graciously offered me a change of seat the move was one to the aft cabin which I chose not to do. Overall if I were to compare Korean to China Airlines or EVA or even JAL and PAL for the money I may choose one of the latter airlines. Although the service and food on KAL is outstanding for a premium product from Seoul to Toronto without flat bed seats seems a little counter-intuitive to me.,Business Class,5,3,5,5,3,3,5,2013,0

Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them.

Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket.

I haven't flown them on an international flight since the late 90's. It was a bad experience then my latest trip was even worse. If you're looking for bad seats bad meals people who hate their jobs then this is your airline. They charged me an extra fee of $100 (USD) for my extra check in bag. I had to pay high prices for any drinks with alcohol on an International flight. They flew us home (9 hour transpacific flight from Tokyo) with a fixed cabin TV screen.

Plane arrived late change of crew quite happy to see that the pilot at least had some experience because in other budget airlines you can have a 25 year old ""captain"". Plane was a recent 737-800 in very good condition. Boarding was un-organized with only one employee at the gate but after there were 2 gateways 1 in front and 1 at the back of the plane to speed boarding. Legroom decent crew did the job. In this kind of airlines you have to pay for food and drinks and I do not contest that but I would like to have at least a good tasty sandwich. They managed to recover part of the delay.

When you pay extra for exit row seats legroom don't sit in the window seat. It has a horizontal bit of door perfect for stretching out your legs (shoes removed of course) but the stewardess will wake you up by shaking your shoulder forbidding you to do this citing a safety issue with the door. There is a sticker on that door bit saying “Do not sit here” something I was not doing. Meal choice was run down to one choice only every meal. The seats on the B777 were painfully narrow painful for me but particularly for the overweight lady being wedged in the chair next to me. Will I fly this airline again - no thank you.

12695,18053,frontier-airlines,A Nelson,United States,"There will be additional fees. You will have to pay for your baggage (both checked and carry-on). Your seat will not be guaranteed unless you pay a minimum of $8 to select your seat. Frontier has a strategy of overbooking presumably to ensure full flights. Every day groups of these extra passengers are forced into later flights. ""Check-in is 45 minutes prior to departure"" means that you will be charged $75 and forced into the next flight if you do not check-in 45 minutes prior to departure. Frontier is the only airline that pulls their employees from the check-in counter and shuts down their check-in computers 45 minutes before departure to ensure that you will not be allowed in if you arrive late. I was running late to my flight this morning and called Frontier's 1-800 number at the suggestion of the friendly JetBlue check-in folks as Frontier's counter had recently been abandoned. I manoeuvred my way through the expected automated system and finally reached a woman who handled my situation with the patience and understanding of a grizzly woken from hibernation. I was interrupted and rudely instructed to be quiet and listen to the rules before rebooking my flight. By the way this airline treats its passengers I should not have expected their employees to be any happier. Frontier employs bait-and-switch policies to maintain the ""cheap ticket"" reputation. In reality Frontier's customers are not presented with an honest estimate of the cost of their travel at checkout. My conclusion is that the service one receives from other airlines is well worth the additional 20% in initial ticket costs. You will end up paying that much more to Frontier anyway.",Economy,1,2,1,1,1,1,9,2014,0

Excellent service throughout on both flights. Food perfectly ok if a little dated although I loved the pre-booked menu for the return flight to London including a Thai style duck curry. I much prefer the older 747s to the A340 in first as the latters cabin is much smaller and uses the older seat style. London Heathrow was a joy in the new terminal two where we use the United Globalfirst lounge. BKK Royal First ground service excellent as always.

Remote parking in Vienna and a run to my gate through passport control where I just made my flight the last to board.

Food inedible I didn't have a credit card so was not able to purchase any drinks or better food (cash is not accepted) entertainment was a tiny overhead monitor every 10 or so rows which I couldn't listen to because again you needed a credit card to purchase headphones. Toilet with baby change was broken on my side of the plane and the aisle to cross over was blocked by an elastic strip so I had to walk all the way to the back of the plane and back around to change my child.

Our Vancouver to Taipei flight was with a 747 so the seats were a little narrow and less roomy but I think that's to be expected with older 747s.

Arrived at the airport at Santiago at 4pm for a 10.30 flight and was told by LAN staff that we could not book in until 8pm. Made inquiries at 6.30 and was told the flight had been cancelled. They provided us with accommodation and meals at Santiago and Auckland but you had to go looking for the information it was never just offered to you. Flight was ordinary to Auckland. We were in the last row and every time the Flight Attendant pushed the trolley out of the galley she hit my wife's seat so sleep was off the cards. More offers of water during the flight would be a good start. We had one good flight and one bad one. Finally when we were given seat allocation we were not sitting together. As it turned out the last 3 centre rows had 4 couples in them and no one was seated together. How hard is it to allocate seating together when tickets are made on the same booking?

2967,3947,air-france,Douglas Levinson,United States,As a Delta Platinum member who flies mostly on Air France I was astonished when Air France took away my wife's seat and put her on a waiting list when traffic kept us from arriving at the airport in Paris until 90 minutes before the flight. This was despite our being on the same reservation - with an 8 year old child with us! I was told that a Flying Blue Elite Plus member would have been treated the same way which is even worse than thinking it was an aberration. This is the second time that Air France's computer system tried to separate my family. Luckily a very nice agent managed to get this fixed although we then had to run to the gate. Then in the flight the food was truly the worst we have ever eaten on an international flight. My son and I ate almost nothing during an 11 hour flight. The deterioration in Air France's food over the last two years is dramatic. On the positive side the crew was very nice and the new 380 aircraft was unusually quiet and had decent leg room for economy seats.

Out tickets were purchased as through tickets and I noticed that they only provided for a 50 minute connection from the AF Hop regional hub which is at the far end of the airport and only accessible by bus through immigration and on to pier E. I emailed twice to seek confirmation that this could be done and was assured on both occasions that it could. Suffice to say it cannot and our connection was missed by 20 minutes (even our case couldn't make it). This is when you fully experience the sharp end of AF's customer service staff who consider you to be something on the bottom of their shoe. We were put on the flight some 3 hrs later sitting at opposite ends of the aircraft despite me telling them my wife was a nervous flyer. During our deliberations at the desk business class went from being full to (upon further pressing) empty and being held so on the rather unlikely event of 8 people turning up half an hour before the flight and buying business class tickets. I didn't want to fly business class but simply suggested that a couple of other passengers could be upgraded freeing up two seats together for my wife and myself. I asked to speak to a manager - none were available. I was told that I was only an economy passenger and that to get anything better I would have to purchase two business class single fares amounting to almost 1000 Euros. Suffice to say when the flight took off there were 6 empty business class seats whilst I was in row 6 and my wife rather uncomfortably in row 24. We could have flown directly with Ryanair to Pisa but I prefer to fly the Flag Carrier experience for a quality of service that was sadly lacking with Air France.

22278,34668,tam-airlines,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,Flew Heathrow to Sao Paulo and then a week later Sao Paulo to Montevideo. First flight was awful. Paid nearly £90 each just for the privilege of an exit seat. Didn't sleep well all the same as plane was freezing cold all the way. Crew were just about polite but nothing more and certainly no engagement. They spent the time during what I assume would have been the safety briefing chatting in the galley. I normally love airline food and am easily impressed typically devouring everything I am given but both my meals were disgraceful attempts at food and if it wasn't for the fact that we got such measly catering on a 12 hour flight I would've left most of it. The crew vanished after the meal service not even returning with more drinks or even water. IFE is about 20 years behind other major airlines so quite depressing on such a long flight. Having paid extra for exit seats there was then nowhere to stow books and magazines etc. The short haul flight was no better. A pre announced 40 minute delay turned into a 2 hour delay with no explanation and little updating along the way. In fact while we were waiting in the lounge our flight disappeared from the gate screen altogether again with no explanation. The 'meal' was a very unpleasant cheese and ham croissant. Really a horrible airline.

18166,27085,precision,W James,Australia,If you are contemplating flying with Precision Air I would caution you before you book. I had 2 experience with Precision recently flying return between Nairobi (NBO) and Kilimanjaro (JRO). Our first leg between NBO and JRO was fine departed and arrived on time and fair service onboard with a cold drink served and a pack of cashew nuts. 2nd leg JRO-NBO was a real problem. Arrived at 8.30am for our 10.55am flight was told our flight was cancelled and put on 3pm flight. No apology and treated it as a matter of fact. It wouldn't be as much problem if we didn't have a connecting flight to catch in Nairobi to Dubai at 4.40pm. So what was an easy connection with more than 4 hours to spare originally arriving NBO at 12pm became 4pm leaving 40mins to catch our connecting flight. Apart from the extra 4 hours spent at JRO which had nothing much to offer we had to stress about whether we could catch our connect flight to Dubai (and later the Maldives). They didn't have the courtesy to contact us beforehand in which case we could alter our subsequent flights. No explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled. While we were there there were a few passengers showing up with news of their flight to Zanzibar being cancelled as well so it appears this is not rare occurrence.

They went above and beyond and the crew genuinely enjoyed coming over to play with and entertain my daughter. They also served her a baby meal - a huge plus. Moreover once we landed in NRT there was some miscommunication about picking up our stroller at the door of the plane. The crew ensured that we got our stroller in a timely manner and provided us with an alternative stroller to get the baggage claim to pick up our stroller where it had ended up.

One month before departure Delta changed the itinerary in Milan-JFK-Minneapolis-Denver which was exactly what I was not looking for (2 stops rather than 1). Too late to change tickets because of high prices. From NY we took off more than 2 hours late most time spent inside a super hot aircraft on a taxiway and consequently we were not able to get the flight from Minneapolis to Denver. Rescheduled for the next day we were forced to spend the night in the airport because the customer service horrible was not able to find a room in Minneapolis.

After being told to go inside and check-in; the guard told us we could not go inside until our flight was posted on the monitor. Furthermore once we arrived at the ticket counter to check our bags and receive our seat numbers the gentleman behind the counter seemed to have little knowledge of his duties.

Outward it couldn't have been better with excellent FAs decent food and arrival that was ahead of schedule. The return started off poorly with substandard facilities at Santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge and no priority boarding.

I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later.

Having read previous reviews of this 'scam' we were prepared and most things were sent as checked in luggage. On boarding we realised that the 7Kg limit including duty free was not a 'scam' but a bare necessity as the plane was so old it did not have the overhead locker space to deal with the modern traveller.

To my pleasant surprise the entire flight experience was excellent. The plane was clearly in great shape a relatively new aircraft with leather seating and spotless interior. The departure and arrival were pretty much on schedule. The fact the departure from Ben Gurion airport was using a shuttle bus and not a jetway reminds me to warn any future passengers during any unlikely (but possible) inclement weather to dress accordingly or bring an umbrella for the extended exposure to the elements while trying to board an outdoors staircase.

The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays.

The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor.

23771,36577,thomson-airways,L Dolder,United Kingdom,We have just travelled to the Maldives on the 787 Dreamliner. We sat in row 35. I think there is a definite design fault with this aircraft. The toilets are at the back which were fine but the ones at row 30 have not been logically placed. They serve everyone in the middle section of the aircraft and people in the low to mid 30's look forward and see these ones rather than the rear ones. On our night flight out theses new loud super flushing toilets with their noisy pivot doors were in constant use. The constant whooshing of the loos and banging of the doors could be heard all night from row 35 goodness knows how cross the people who paid for extra leg room in row 30 must gave felt. As if this wasn't enough of a noise the cabin crew obviously had lost something as with a small light they proceeded to open every single overhead storage compartment and close it 3 times during the night I guess it was the forms you fill in to gain access to the Maldives as they announced they had run out before we landed. I also feel that although the leg room is good the width room didn't feel very spacious and due to the configuration of 3x3x3 there were a lot of people who I guess hadn't booked seats together who were across isles or one behind each other for the flight. The captains messages were also not very loud and clear so you couldn't always hear what had been said.

Neither my friend on the same booking or I received any notification that the time had changed. After the arduous task that is getting through security check at Helsinki airport at 06h50 we hear over the PA that we were running late and have 1 min to board. On boarding the guy next to us showed us an SMS he'd received earlier that morning to say it was now early - where was my message? To change the time to choose to not notify me and then give me poor attitude and sass as I approach the plane on the gangway when I'm not in the wrong is disgusting. Return flight was fine. Return was only 10 mins late there was no attitude and we were kept updated. However bearing in mind that all they can do is promote the fact that they're the first European airline to offer free wifi onboard you should know that it is incredibly slow to connect to the initial page outside their own domain. Additionally if the captain or purser make an announcement it resets the wifi and you have to endure that wait all over again so the free wifi that they use as the balance to all negativity is not all that great. There is no offer of anything regarding food/drink despite the flight time and it being international but I figure that's a Nordic thing maybe? Other points like seating are neutral. They're not cramped but not the most comfortable. IFE was pathetic. In all fly with Norwegian if you only care about price or if it absolutely essential that you have onboard wifi and can handle the speeds/resets.

This made the long flight bearable. The flight was packed but the crew were cheerful and efficient and did everything right. Food was so-so - getting a bit weary of the standard kebabs and mystery veggies. The IFE was excellent - far better than Emirates' much touted IFE and better than QR. On the way back was checked in by a surly female agent at JFK. She couldn't find me an exit row on the A-330 to IST but said she found me a bulkhead one on the IST-DXB leg. The A330 was surprisingly comfortable much more so that the 777 even for my 6'3"" frame and the young lady next to me just curled up and slept the whole way through and was no bother to me. On the home leg I found that the seat the JFK agent had got me a seat in the row behind the bulkhead! On the 777 with the seats compressed for the 'short-haul' 4 hour flight to DXB I found sitting was unbearable. I silently cursed this agent and couldn't wait to deplane and get home. Service was once again good and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and tasty. But any satisfaction I got from this was neutralized by the uncomfortable seat and the incompetence of the check-in agent at JFK. This is the second time this has happened to me. A year ago flying from AGP-IST-DOH the agent at AGP assured me she had got me an exit row and I found myself directly behind exit row in a non-reclining seat. TK has to train its check-in staff to read the seat map better. Am contemplating a trip very soon to AGP and then later to BOS and wondering whether to fly TK after these twin disasters.",Economy,7,3,5,4,5,4,2,2015,1

I flew from Bangkok to Seoul on a 777-200 in business with the very nice seat configuration 1-2-1 and back in another 777-200 but alas with a 2-3-2 configuration. In any case service was good flight attendants very attentive meal excellent with very good steaks not something you find on all airlines and a reasonable choice of wines. Champagne was served before take-off but aperitifs were not offered. Amenities for a night flight were reduced to the bare minimum but the worst was the pre-historic entertainment system: it is a VOD but the choice is absolutely minimal a shame for such a good airline and I wonder how they could be the airline of the year with such in-flight entertainment. In Bangkok we could enjoy the nice Thai Business Lounge whereas in Seoul the Asiana Lounge was offered with excellent seating very good internet connections but an appallingly poor selection of food and drinks.,Business Class,8,4,5,5,2,5,4,2014,1
16239,24278,lot-polish-airlines,R Pieper,Germany,I was on flight 85 from Hanoi to Warsaw with connecting flight to Berlin. The Flight was scheduled for 11.55 but was delayed for 5 hrs. Unlike most passengers we realised there would be a delay 18 hrs in advance after having problems with the online check-in. Even though the airline was aware of a significant delay no effort was made to inform passengers. No information on our right to compensation under EU regulations was given either. Adding insult to injury the flight attendants on the plane ignored any request for information or service. At one stage I had the assistance lamp on for an hour before I gave up and went to the back to find attendants chatting leisurely. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich with cheese and water. No yoghurt or muffin as included in the regular meal. Again a sign of minimal effort. Even though this flight was relatively cheap it was not good value at all and staff made no effort to improve what was obviously a terrible experience. I would not recommend flying with this airline on a long haul flight.,Economy,2,3,1,2,3,2,12,2011,0

The Saga Class seats are behind the times and it is time for Icelandair to upgrade them to a fully flat-bed configuration. The inflight service could do with some improvement especially in the training of flight attendants. When I asked for a vegetarian option not only was one not available the flight attendants did not make any attempt to find alternative options or show the least bit of concern.

5054,6975,allegiant-air,E English,United States,I fly a lot and when I heard Allegiant was coming to Indianapolis I was very excited. That changed quickly. Be prepared for the following fees on top of the airfare: Between $15-$30 to choose your seat. That's each way not round trip. If you are flying with a family there is an extra $100 easy. $15 each way for a carry on bag. You can only bring a lap top bag for free. $15 to use a credit card when checking out. $50 for a checked bag. Online booking fee. $5 to print boarding pass if you do at the airport. All in all it was about $60 cheaper than Southwest for me to get to Tampa from IND. If they just rolled all those fees into the total price I would be happy. But they make you first decline a hotel rental car attractions trip protection. Then you have to go page by page with the fees. By the time I got hit with a $15 credit card fee I was exhausted. Also no place to put your Known Traveler Number. Be ready to wait on hold for over 30min for that. I'm afraid if I do it at the airport they will charge me another $10!,Economy,2,2,4,3,2,3,1,2015,0

One of my passengers forced me to sit in the emergency aisle the design of the arm rests for the emergency aisle seats make leg comfort too tight. Food was excellent and crew are very attentive. IFE content was limited on board due to the flight being a regional trip but is updated nonetheless. Flight was quick and on time. Second flight was on board an uncommon aircraft which allowed me to see inside their mid-haul fleet. Check- in is slow but this could be a result of the ongoing renovation of DPS. I was able to not sit in the emergency aisle. Seat pitch on board the 333 is very good fits tall passengers. Seat layout of 2-4-2 does not make seating tight another big plus. Attentive FA excellent food but IFE is limited again. The seat did not provide a USB gate even though the IFE menu has the option to access media from the USB. Great flight though.

I last flew with them back in the late 80's and back then couldn't rate them more highly. What a great airline they were even though I flew economy I was treated as if I was in first class. Now I would compare them to Ryanair or some such other cheap airline. They really pack you in like sardines even on long haul (7 hour plus flights) most of these flights left us in physical pain from being so squashed in. The aircraft's are looking old and tired. We nearly didn't get on one flight (Sydney to Queenstown) as they had over booked it. The ground crew did try their best to be helpful and we did finally manage to make it onto the flight but had to be rushed through even though we'd arrived a good 2.5 hours before our flight. They weren't able to seat us together which is so disappointing when you have booked seats in advance. I hate this level of poor service.

I did listen to some music though. The service on board was generally good at least on the side of the aircraft I was on. The stewardess who served was very kind and attentive. The food was good although I got a sense that something was missing from the meal overall. It wasn't highly appealing. I also find the seats comfortable they are softer than those on Singapore Airlines. I slept very well and I'm not usually one to sleep particularly well on flights.

In fact we changed our original date from 19 to 20 Jul as we were told by the agent that there was no Premium Economy configuration on the earlier date. We had no problems when we flew the same itinerary in 2011 but this incident has certainly left us with a bad impression of how EVA Air treats its customers.

On the outbound flight our tickets said the flight was 12.20 but it was in fact displayed as 12.00. Check in staff were unfriendly put the wrong seat numbers on our boarding cards which we spotted otherwise our family would have been separated. Boarding was called 20 minutes before the inbound aircraft arrived and the aircraft left late resulting in standing in line for over an hour to board as there was minimal seating in the boarding area. The interior of the aircraft was dark and gloomy cabin lights were left off. The seating was cramped which meant the passenger in front could not recline his seat. The cabin service was shambolic the crew attempted to serve food and drinks from the same trolley and were constantly running our of things and were going up and down the aisles for more items constantly took over an hour to serve the meal. The meal was disgusting and was stone cold and my drink was half a glass of flat diet coke the crew had run out and didn't want to get another bottle. Staff were not friendly and continually forgot to serve people due to the distraction of running out of food. For most of the flight the aisles were blocked with crew with trolleys and food trays were not collected for a long time. Combined with turbulence it was not possible to visit the two economy class toilets for some time and it was not allowed to use them on the ground in Istanbul. On a positive note baggage collection and immigration in Ercan was fast and efficient. The return flight was slightly better boarding was more ordered cabin service more organised and cabin light switched on. Check in however was shambolic. When we landed at Istanbul most passengers had to change seats but had not been advised resulting in chaos and families being split up.

One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer).

Good IFE with great selection of films and it was easy to use. Food and drink was ok although I didn't have the snacks. MY only complaint were the seats they were rock hard and it felt like sitting on a slab of concrete after 6 hours.

I was hungry half way through the flight and wanted a snack but was told there was no snacks and had to wait for the meal service several hours later. Next time I will book Qantas.

Rouge represents a major drop in quality from Air Canada. There is no entertainment centre and the leg room is the same that I experienced on an Air Transat charter flight when we were packed in like sardines - my knees were touching the seat in front of me. Anyone over 5' 11' is simply not going to fit in the tiny seats.

I found  rudeness characterizes how UA treats its customers. For example, it was clearly printed on my e-ticket that prepared meals would be provided, but what they do not say is that you first have to ask about the meal (flight staff never mentioned that food was even available), and then you are told to look at the menu if you want to purchase any food. The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief. Aside from behaving as though they were doing you a favour by even noticing that you were on the flight, several of the staff would openly talk about and complain about passengers within hearing distance of the passengers themselves.

B777 is superb but older Airbus A330/340 product not as good but believe they are having interior upgrade to newer B787 style - we flew our first B787 on the initial LHR-DOH leg and it was fantastic. Could not pick a single fault and as a plane geek it truly is an amazing aircraft made the B777 feel almost outdated which is crazy as they are still fantastic aircraft and so spacious. Both were less than a month old! Qatar lounge in LHR is a real treat-up there with the BA Concorde Room in my opinion - worth getting there early just to enjoy the food wine and ambience. Looking forward to the new Doha airport as current transit can be a bit of a bore but would still chose to fly Qatar above any other airline despite the connection.

13709,19684,icelandair,J Walton,Ireland,Returned from Iceland to Ireland via London Heathrow last Thursday June 19th on Flight FI454 from KEF at 16.10 At 4.30 informed that the flight was now confirmed to take off at 17.00. No announcement was made no explanations given and no one from Icelandair appeared to answer the passengers questions and concerns. Flight eventually took off at 17.20 and was further delayed at London Heathrow due to a time slot to land. The pilot on welcoming us on board explained that the delay was due to a member of the cabin crew becoming ill and a replacement crew member having to be got. He also apologised for the delay. I was to originally have 2 and a half hours between landing in Heathrow and taking off again on a connecting flight to Ireland. I barely had an hour to get off go through passport control rush to baggage reclaim check in for connecting flight go through customs and get to the boarding gate. As it worked out I just got to the boarding gate in time and this was due to two factors. One was that there was no queue both at the check-in desk and at customs and secondly the cabin crew on flight FI454 allowed me to move from my allotted seat in the 2nd last row to a seat in row 6 near the exit door for the last 20 minutes of the flight and so allowed me to get off quickly. My sincerest thanks to the cabin crew. This was my 5th return trip to Iceland on holidays since 1991 and using Icelandair each time. This particular experience has left me wary of using Icelandair again and of considering using alternative airlines in travelling to Iceland on future trips.,Economy,5,3,5,3,0,4,6,2014,0

Beside that by now we all know what a great design this A380 is and how much more peaceful it is inside this airplane when flying.

AF crew are usually always very polite they seem to enjoy their jobs again. Catering has improved again and food quality is very close to what I remembered it was so many years ago and one of the reasons I became a regular customer of AF. Also noticeable is the new design of cutlery even if made from plastic using them makes it much easier to enjoy the food.

Apart from free drinks it is all very basic and it can be hard to find anywhere to sit. On a positive note the crew were absolutely outstanding and the food was very good. Unfortunately as we were on an Airbus it was obvious that too many Upper Class seats have been squeezed in.

There was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. No lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. Not surprisingly there was no priority boarding. Our seats 2D and 2E are the only decent seats in the new Club Europe. Service on board was adequate.

For a long haul flight costing over $900USD one way I think this is a bit mean ""breakfast"" was a joke a cling film wrapped ham and cheese roll and about 100ml of water in a foil sealed plastic tub tossed out.

The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus.

During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm. Also that the Slovenian liqueur speciality advertised in their in-flight Duty Free catalogue is not carried on board. All flights on time.,Business Class,7,2,5,4,0,4,6,2013,1

All flights on time check-in and embarkation monitored by cabin crews. All aircraft's clean modern and comfortable. Thanks to thin backseats the pitch seems larger than usual and to add to feeling of comfort the seats are equipped with footrests. Special mention to the Dreamliner brand new aircraft and serving several domestic destinations before entering service on international lines. The 'magic' stops here. No announcement given by captains. Average service from aircrews keeping a correct attitude and acting professionally. Food is below average both in quality and presentation. No menu given and on each flight almost the same choice of main course is proposed: vegetables or chicken with rice. Breakfast is very basic. All meals served in low quality plastic even picnic cutlery on long-haul you are afraid to break while using! Drinks are served before meals but take care as no drinks are served with meals (a mini bottle of mineral water comes in your plastic tray). AVOD delivers a basic but correct selection of classic and more recent movies Hollywood and Bollywood. All in all the AI product is simple the service minimum while acceptable as prices are on the low side. The food should really be improved and is not at the level one can expect from a flag carrier.,Economy,5,4,3,2,3,3,10,2012,1

15293,22826,jetstar-airways,B Lamprell,Vietnam,It's a quick trip between these 2 cities but passengers spend longer at the airports than on the plane. Bag drop at Melbourne was a slow process. About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front. Thankfully they didn't recline the seat. A 15 minute delay in Sydney waiting for a clear air-bridge and a 20 minute wait to collect our bags capped off an uneventful flight.,Economy,7,3,4,3,0,3,2,2013,1

Cabin is clean and seat is only as comfortable as any economy seat can be. Inflight meal: got a pleasant surprise of satay being served to all economy passengers. Although only a very small portion it is a remarkably nice effort. Both lunch and dinner are adequately proportion edible nice. Seated at 80G the flight attendant in charge of that aisle was excellent. She helped 2 elderly couples who initially were seated in the middle 80E F to empty seats in front for their convenience. Same upbeat moods were also seen in other staff casual chat with passengers including helping some of the passengers in taking pictures. Inflight entertainment is good. Wide selections with both new and old movies all functioning well. Flight overall was smooth. Landing is smooth as always. Arrival is about 30mins late and that is inclusive of 3 circles over London sky due to congestion in Heathrow. Luggage are out by the time I got through the immigration. No damage noted. All in all a very satisfactory journey and glad to see the cabin staff in an upbeat mood. With the price that I got (unbelievably low) it's really a winner.,Economy,10,4,5,5,4,5,3,2015,1

I have nothing negative to say about Cubana at all and as far as their planes the ones used for trips from Ontario to Cuba during the winter months are an Avion wet lease which are in partnership with Thompson so no worries as to who maintains and looks after the fleet of planes.

Part of the menu was just not available and other options had so little quantities that they became unavailable.

We did not have seat details for this leg until check in and they seemed very perplexed at the check-in counter about what to do about onward flights in business class. The girl on the desk did not even know where KL was! After boarding the flight there was a problem with the plane and after a wait we were moved onto a different smaller plane and all allocated seat numbers then became obsolete and we ended up somewhere near the back. On the flight from Paris the choice of main course had run out before they got to us on row 7! The food was ok had better and had far worse maybe my expectations were rather high with it being a French airline. The cabin staff were very good. The seats were flat but slightly angled and as a result not quite as comfortable as could have been. I also found the fabric of the seat a bit on the scratchy side and ended up having to put a blanket between me and the seat to make it more comfortable for sleeping. Was surprised on the return leg to find the plane stopped away from the terminal and we had to be bussed in fortunately the plane was on time or this could have made catching our connection very tight. It was a very reasonable price and I would fly with them again if I could not get a good price from the likes of Emirates or Singapore airlines.,Business Class,7,3,4,4,3,4,1,2014,1

Flying through middle east is slightly shorter than the traditional stop in Singapore or another Asian city and Qatar is about as good as economy class gets. The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock.

The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. Additionally the beer on board is better than other airlines Warsteiner. The food is similar to others in the same category - the only complaint is the number of films available. Perhaps there are 50 different films but compared to Etihad or others this falls a bit short by today's standards.

2123,2874,air-canada-rouge,Lewis Deitch,United States,I have been an Air Canada Aeroplan member for over 30 years and I do a lot of overseas traveling from my home base in Phoenix Arizona. Fortunately Air Canada has connected Phoenix with Toronto since the mid 1990's making overseas connections quite easy. In winter there is additional service to Calgary which enables flight connections to London and Frankfurt. Recently Phoenix service was converted to the new Air Canada Rouge budget category. All I kept reading were negative reviews about how cramped the business class was and how poor the food and service were. I traveled to Toronto on July 1 to connect to Frankfurt and returned from Toronto (Copenhagen) on August 30. Frankly I found nothing wrong with Air Canada Rouge. Yes the seats are smaller coach seats with the middle seat blocked out. But there was almost as much legroom as on a regular Air Canada domestic flight. As for lunch en route to Toronto and Breakfast returning to Phoenix the food quality was comparable to a regular domestic Air Canada flight. And the young flight attendants though not clearly as experienced were very attentive. I would prefer a return of regular Air Canada service but I did find Rouge an acceptable choice and with Calgary now being a year around connection and the addition of Vancouver I am very pleased. These are short flights and the added comfort of domestic first class would be nice but I for one can live without it.,Business Class,8,3,5,5,2,4,9,2014,1

They fly the Newark - Porto route twice/week and the Newark - Lisbon route the remaining 5 days. I paid only $789 for the round trip multi city flight and although I couldn't pick seats until 24 hours prior to departure I got window seats both ways and a bulkhead window seat on the return from Lisbon to Newark (11j)! Food was decent/edible although they were a little stingy on wine and tea/coffee ( they only fill glasses half way and are bad on refills). The A332 from Newark to Porto was newer then the return aircraft and had touchscreen on demand entertainment with dozens of movies including new releases like 12 yrs a slave and Dallas Buyers Club. The return A332 had personal TVs as well but the movies were on channels 1-16 and started at a set time. Flew Portugalia operated Fokker 100 to Brussels from Porto which was fine. They served a lox sandwich. Food on the return Lisbon to EWR flight had descent food - fish pie (like shepherds) and a prosciutto sandwich as a snack before landing. All edible which is how I rate airline food (edible or non-edible).,Economy,8,5,4,4,4,5,3,2014,1

We took advantage of the business class lounge (paid about $50 per person) and thought it was well worth it for the food wine and quiet. The premium economy seats although roomier than economy were nowhere near business class standards so do not expect to get a comfortable night's sleep. I did appreciate the extra legroom and the fixed shell design as this made it feel quite spacious. The food was really quite good (though keep in mind it is from an airline not a French bistro) and the service was very polite and friendly. I felt very taken care of the entire flight and would definitely travel on Air France again over most of its competitors.,Premium Economy,9,3,5,5,5,5,7,2013,1

There was no 'on demand' video system and was told that Virgin would be operating this old aircraft on this route for some time to come. I recently travelled business class from Tokyo to London on BA and Shanghai to London on Cathay. I have to say that both airlines were miles ahead of Virgin in all aspects. It is a real shame.

19486,28934,royal-brunei-airlines,Geoff Butler,United Kingdom,Having chosen this airline based on reviews here and the competitive price of a return ticket from London to Melbourne I was not disappointed. Service by flight attendants was top-notch even in the dead of night. The Boeing 777s might not be the latest but they are still up to the task; the seats were comfortable and the IFE was perfectly adequate. As previous reviews have pointed out Brunei airport can't presently be compared with Singapore or even Kuala Lumpur but as the cabin crew pointed out on landing there on both the outbound and return legs the airport is undergoing substantial renovation so there's hope for a better layover experience. My only slight gripe was that only one meal was served on the outbound leg from Brunei to Melbourne - lunch - with no snacks or other food served before landing which seemed a bit stingy given the length of the flight. That said the food served was generally excellent - tasty and better than other airline food I've eaten in the past! Boarding at Brunei on the return leg from there to Dubai was a little chaotic but this might have been the fault of the airport rather than the airline. The 2 stop itinerary - Dubai and Brunei - actually suited me quite well as I hate being cooped up in a plane for hours on end. Given the great level of customer service on board and the competitive pricing this airline has a lot to recommend it.,Economy,9,4,5,5,4,5,9,2012,1

No entertainment was provided whatsoever. Apparently Westjet is moving to this business model of making tablets available to rent for $5 each but only on flights of 3 hr + 20 min or longer. Edmonton to Las Vegas is 3 hr. Passengers weren't informed of this condition until 10 minutes prior to boarding! At the very least Westjet should have posted notice of this ""discount service"" flight online prior to our booking and reduced the price accordingly. Even the smiling joking flight attendants couldn't make up for Westjet's poor judgement. If and when portable tablets are made available for rent here again is another nickle-and-dime scheme from a once reputable airline.

I informed him I handed him the new ticket with my passport and if he took time he would have noticed. I asked him politely why he literally threw the papers at me even if I was flying with Aegean and if that was how he was trained to deal with the public. I also asked him if I needed a manager to check me in. Then after no apology he then checked me in and I was on my way. I go to Greece often and this experience is why I usually try to fly Aegean. The flight itself was a joke. They set up the beverage cart to serve two people (me and one other in front) and then took cart to back to breakdown.

From Athens to Doha my husbands screen didn't work and only towards the end of flight did the air hostess offer for him to change seats. She kept on forgetting to help and by then he had cut losses and tried to sleep. We also had a 10 hour stopover. All my family who have had long stopovers had been given complimentary hotel rooms. For this reason we decided to book on Qatar. As the time got closer I mailed to ask about this, the staff replies were short, rude and unhelpful. The told me all the places we could pay to stay at, which we had not budgeted for. So we had a horrid stopover at airport. Second time using Qatar and this will be my last.

Strange croissant with a pretzel coating (but in my past experience Swiss food is not nice, even in business) and wide selection of drinks including alcohol. I had flown out on Austrian and the quality of Swiss is just a couple of notches higher. I did check in online but the Swiss website sends you to Lufthansa for some reason.

Now I only use it to fly from Moruya where we have a second home to Sydney and it is always a really unpleasant experience. The check-in and gate lounge staff are really rude at Sydney (every trip it is the same) and the flight attendants are unpleasant and seem untrained. At Moruya the ground staff always seem very unprofessional. Last time (late January 2015) we had to fly to Moruya via Merimbula and were told to leave our hand-luggage on board and so I left a magazine on board. When I returned it had disappeared. I went up to speak to the flight attendant anxious whether cleaners might have removed it and taken it into the terminal and we might take off without it. She ignored me for several minutes before finding it (she had removed it - although we had booked the same seats right through of course - and the plane wasn't full so she should even have remembered us!) and returning it without a word of apology. I am hanging out for the day when another airline services Moruya and I never have to fly Rex again. We could get to Moruya from our home airport of Melbourne via Merimbula and a drive from there but instead we choose to fly to Canberra with any other airline and drive from there as we hate flying Rex so much.,Economy,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2015,0

These seats should be fixed in the one position to make it fair for everyone! When it came to meal time my tray sloped at a 45 degree angle meaning my meal would have slid off the tray. Each time meals/drinks were served I had to ask the stewardess to ask the person in front to put their seat upright. Apart from that the plane is good. There are 7 toilets are located down a set of stairs which is ideal and gives plenty of space. There are also 2 toilets located at the front and rear of the plane. Food is good.

KLM was convenient for me as I live in Birmingham and could therefore travel to Doha via Amsterdam without the need to travel down to London. The ticket price was also the cheapest available for this trip. The short hop from Birmingham to Amsterdam only takes about an hour but the 06.00 departure always serves a cold breakfast sandwich with tea coffee or juices. The layover in Amsterdam was 1 hour 55 minutes giving more than enough time to make my connection. The flight to Doha was not full whereas most Qatar Airways flights are as most of the passengers will be transiting. Once airborne the passenger next to me was offered the choice of moving seats so that we could all spread out a little making the journey much more comfortable. The IFE is adequate but the screen a little small though there is a good range of entertainment. On the outbound flight there were only two options for economy main course but the food was reasonable as airline food goes. All flights departed and arrived on time the crew were very good and I was pleasantly surprised that despite being the cheapest choice for my route KLM provided a service that I was more than happy with.

We were two people booked together and on our PVG-SYD and PVG-LHR flights (which we checked in for over 13 hours in advance as they were our second flights) we weren't given seats together despite specifically requesting it for the return SYD-PVG-LHR flights at the check-in desk. We went to the service helpdesk and the woman was able to change it with no problems so not sure why the original guy couldn't give us seats together. We noticed a number of couples and groups not seated together on the PVG-SYD flight so definitely request it when checking in and follow up at the service desk if still not seated together.

I told her that her reclined seat was causing me pain. At this point a member of the cabin crew arrived. After informing him of the problem he told me that she was quite within her rights to move the back of her seat and that I should have informed Thomson of my knee problem before the flight. He then went away and did nothing further until after an hour of agony my wife insisted that another seat be found for me. This he grudgingly did. Whilst I have to concede that there are people in this country who are prepared to let others endure over 4 hours of agony whilst they lay back in comfort.

10596,15317,emirates,Powell Michael,United Kingdom,LHR-DXB-PER-DXB-LHR. The trip out to Perth was almost a tale of two different airlines. LHR-DXB on the A380. The Heathrow lounge is dull and there was little sign of staff. It was not made clear that boarding would be straight from the lounge. Once on board a welcome drink was proposed but never arrived. No amenities kit was offered. The plastic bags they put the headphones etc in look cheap and nasty. The much-vaunted wireless IFE controller would not unlock from its dock so not much use. 3 different cabin staff said they would deal with it but nothing was achieved. Meal service was unduly slow. No drinks served (as promised) before the end of the flight. The promised Dubai gate information on IFE channel 94 didn't materialise. Yes it was business class but it was all very impersonal and irritating. The toilets are just by the bar area so if you are queuing you are mixed up with the bar clients - not a comfortable arrangement. DXB-PER on a B777 was totally different: perfect service and everything worked. PER-DXB the seatbelt adjuster didn't work and couldn't be fixed and they eventually cobbled something together with an extender - a bit embarrassing to be presented with that in front of other passengers. Again the IFE controller didn't work. We got to the Dubai area on schedule then had to hold for 40 minutes due to congestion. When we landed we were parked at a (very) remote stand which meant a long bus ride to the terminal. Terminal 3 is enormous and impersonal and there was no time left to do any duty free shopping. DXB-LHR was ok. The IFE controller didn't work - again! So all in all I'm not that satisfied with Emirates. There seems to be a lack of attention to detail. I've flown LHR-PER once a year for the past 10 years and have used Qantas Singapore Malaysian and Qatar all in business class. I'd rank Emirates at the bottom of this list.

The passenger next to me continually had their head in my lap while trying to access their under seat storage. When the passenger in front fully reclined their seat I briefly thought about offering them money to return their seat back so that I could have a few more inches of space. The entertainment system is not well thought out. Passengers on both my flights were not using headphones to watch their devices. Volume levels were on high to compete with the jet noise and their hearing aids. With the in-flight entertainment system headphones are required to access the entertainment sound. None of the flight attendants addressed the lack of headphone use issue but instead preferred to ignore it. The entertainment selection on the Rouge app is not appealing.

Catering OK although no choice for the starters (this should be improved). Good choice in terms of drinks and possibility to access a bar at all time during the flight. Possibility to have a quick dinner service (without main course) thanks to a very efficient flight attendant; that was very appreciated on a night flight as we were keen on sleeping as soon as possible (and even more appreciated considering that the dinner service with AF is usually way too long). The IFE is a little bit poor and the user interface is not very friendly (the way of listing the movies for instance should be improved - it always takes a lot of time to go through the whole lot).

This is not the first time BA's food has been suspect either their club Europe service to Gibraltar also serves up light cold snacks though charging up to £750 return for a 2.5hour flight. For those looking to fly BA the lounges aircraft and staff are good to go but the food needs to be improved.,First Class,9,4,5,3,4,4,1,2015,1
4534,6176,airasia,T Kimberley,United Kingdom,We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Vientiane and back and found Air Asia very good both the ground staff and cabin crew were excellent the aircraft was one of the cleanest I have travelled on and the cost and range of drinks and food were also very good. Outbound flight departed on time and on our return we actually departed a little early. Keeping in mind the low price we paid for tickets for a two and half hour flight Air Asia provided excellent value for money and we would certainly use them again.,Economy,10,5,5,5,0,5,12,2012,1
21656,33573,spirit-airlines,D Ray,United States,The worst airline in existence. We traveled from New York to Dallas this past weekend. We hovered over Dallas for 30 minutes because of weather and were then told we would have to re-route to Houston. After flying to Houston our plane and 2 others sat on the tarmac for 2 hours waiting to fly back to Dallas. Spirit apparently only has 3 pilots because they couldn't find one to fly us back so they ended up putting all passengers on the 3 planes on buses to go back to DFW. We ended up renting a car and driving back as we had paid for an airline ticket not a bus ticket. I will never use Spirit again. They are unorganized and not very helpful. Huge waste of money after the all of charges for seats and luggage.,Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,2014,0

We flew on the A340-600 which is quite old and is not lie flat but its decent enough. The lounge in Doha is horrible especially compared to the old one. Its huge impersonal and it feels like most of the airport is in there with you rather than being a quiet sanctuary. More like a school canteen than a business lounge.

However, I booked priority bags for myself and wife both ways but did not receive the service as the bags came off the aircraft without having been given any apparent priority and some time after the first bags came off. There seemed to be two separate issues with the service. On the outbound flight the bags were not tagged by the check-in desk and so were not identified as priority bags. On the inbound flight, I had to point out that we had paid for priority bags at the check-in, otherwise they were not going to be tagged, but even then the bags came on to the carousel on arrival in a completely random order, the first of any tagged bags arriving about 40th, the next 60th and ours some time after that. So, there was a problem at both check-in and arrival. A further problem became apparent when I made a complaint. The customers service agent offered a 50% refund on the mistaken belief that I was only complaining about one flight and has not been prepared to budge in spite of numerous e-mails to put the record straight so I am afraid with Thomas Cook it's ""No Priority Bags"" and ""Bad Customer Relations"".",Economy,2,4,4,4,2,1,6,2015,0

Staff were like the keystone cops trying to get things moving. On the way home the flight left 1hr late even though we could all see the plane on the tarmac with no explanation given. Stop-off in Saskatoon to drop off passengers and do a ""crew change"" became a 2 hour fiasco as the replacement crew were locked out of the closed airport. Different stories were given on what was going on but when the new crew arrived they told the remaining passengers to complain to the Saskatoon Airport Authority for locking up for the night. Surely this was not the first time this route has been taken. Sunwing came across as teh keystone cops. When we complained that our seat was in permanent recline mode and wouldn't stay up for take- off or landing the flight attendant told us not to worry about it and that there were 6 other seats on the plane with similar issues.

Even though the seat wasn't a fully flat bed I had a good sleep and woke up rested before landing to Doha. The next leg to Budapest was on a 321 not bad but you can't compare it with the business class from the wide- bodied aircraft's.

Picked up the boarding pass at the airport via self service machine without any trouble. Boarding was efficient and quick. Plane (B777-300ER) left on time. I am not that big but leg (and knee) space was more than enough (considering it was economy). Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back. I had a good short haul experience (B737-800). Leg space good and nice crew. Nice snacks were served there as well. I had the same experience on return and I must say that I considered KLM a great airline.,Economy,9,4,5,5,4,5,7,2013,1

Transfer in Cologne/Bonn was easy and Germanwings agents very good. From Cologne to Vienna the flight was not so busy and seats were free. Another good crew and great flight. As you should expect in flight beverages not cheap. However the 3 fare types - basic: no free refreshments hand luggage only smart: checked bag included free refreshments (sandwich 2 drinks) best: different cabin checked bag unlimited free refreshments - is a good effective system.

Have used them for several years travelling in business (would hesitate to recommend them for economy as the leg room is one of the worst). Flight was early food quite appetising and the crew were 10/10 with a great flight manager. Return trip not so hot. My wife's inflight monitor was not working the crew rebooted it twice which promptly knocked out mine. Gave us both a portable unit but the two films I had selected from the in flight mag were not on the pad. My wife's ran dry with low battery warning after about an hour and a half. One complaint is that their wines (proudly supplied by Berry Bros) always seem a bit over the top. I enjoy a few glasses during the flight but often they disappoint.

The seats on both aircraft's had plenty of legroom. Though the in-flight entertainment on the A320 was not switched on the one on the Dreamliner was excellent. The cabin lighting on the 12 hour flight from DEL to MEL was perfectly set. The cabin crew service was excellent. The 3 meals (both flights combined) served was very good. Both flights were on time.

This time all of the above except weather. 763 with no space pod seating that is really showing it's age and lack of cleaning. Inedible breakfast mash of soggy pancakes and rubber sausage. Crew pleasant enough but given very low grade product to work with. On return the crew were efficient but perfunctory and the food just as awful. When I asked how well the beef was done the attendant replied that they didn't know as all they were told by the company was to put it in the galley oven and cook for twenty minutes same for all the meals.

I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn.

Elite class was a good choice separate cabin and toilets wider comfortable seats with a foot rest and enough entertainment choices for 30 hours flying. Food agreeable to all tastes due to the variety and pleasant enough. There must have been about 20+ staff I guess they work in shifts.

Some mechanical problem caused further delays. 4 hours on the tarmac further delays then deplaned to spend the night in Saskatoon. Only one attendant handing out vouchers at 3am. 1pm departure the next day became 3pm. Flight Saskatoon to Vancouver and landing were uneventful.

Always a great selection of beverages but food offerings just average lately. Entertainment options also not that great with limited new release films. Contract lounge in Papeete is pathetic and almost not worth the effort. Still our preferred airline as great crew compensate for the other shortcomings.

I do have a few issues with this flight- the bathrooms had not been cleaned and smelt terrible! I think a flight attendant did a good clean up mid flight as it seemed to improve as the flight went on. Surely not appreciated by her. My other issue with Air Canada on both flights is that the cancelled their pre dinner drink run. Cost cutting? Maybe. And the food was pretty lousy too. My children's meals in particular were terrible. Finally our IFE had a glitch and the first 40 rows had their programming interrupted about 20 times.

Throughout the flight there was constant bad language which was not once addressed by the crew even with small children only a couple of rows back. It seemed that two young female members of the crew seemed to think they were on a social night out with the guys from the stag do and spent most of the flight sat in the galley talking to them allowed them to help themselves to the drinks!

The connecting flights were the ones that caused problems. On our outward journey there was only one hour allowed for us to get to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Dhaka. This one hour is too little. I am 71 years old and I was made to run behind the porter who was young and strong and was running and pushing my wife in a wheelchair through various check points to get us to the connecting flights on time. On the way back it was even worse. This time the time allowed for changeover at Istanbul was 1.5 hrs. The plane arrived late and after a very long wait the plane eventually stopped on one part of the runway. Passengers were bussed away and then the marathon began for them to get to the terminal for connecting flights. Same again running behind the porter pushing and running with my wife in the wheelchair. He managed to get us to the plane but just. There was no onboard entertainment on the flight from Dhaka to Istanbul.,Economy,1,3,4,4,2,1,4,2014,0

Hour plus delay on both sectors no explanation from ground staff or flight crew and a long long wait for bags to come through at Barajas T4 on the return. Air Nostrum have started to charge for catering like their parent company and on the return sector the FAs said they'd run out of all food on the outbound flight.

20441,30622,scoot,J Brooks,Thailand,Booked a return flight from BKK to SG. Pre-selected window seat in the red seating of the aircraft. The seats were very thin - ok for a short haul 2 hour flight. The person in front reclined their seat which literally meant I had a headrest in my face. Flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. Cabin attendants were far from 'fun vibrant' crew members mentioned in all the airline PR. More like exhausted/frustrated with their job. One snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the pre-ordered sandwich she had just been given. All in all an ok flight. Decided to upgrade to Biz scootz for the return leg just. Very easy to upgrade in SG - 99 SD plus 20SD administration fee. Seats on aircraft cannot and should never be compared to a normal business class product on every other airline. Meal was good.

IFE was excellent with plenty of movies to choose from. However I was very disappointed with the service and food on all legs. Half the crew seemed grumpy the whole time and not a smile was to be seen. Two very bland meals were served on each leg. We got hungry mid-flight on several of the legs and asked if they had any snacks but all they could offer was some crackers and cheese. Crew were not particularly diligent in going round with water/drinks during the flights so most of the time I ended up going to the galley myself. Overall a disappointment.

The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines!

It took LH staff over 30 minutes to resolve, but in the end, I am sitting comfortably onboard. Boarding was efficient and smooth, and my seat (exit row 28L) is perfect. We pushed back 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin crew have been particularly attentive, efficient, and friendly. Beverage and meal service were quick. My only complaint is with the new economy drink and meal service. Although the inflight menu continues to list sparkling wine as available for purchase, the reality is that in economy, champagne is not to be had for love nor money. This is a discrepancy that should be resolved, either by changing the information in the inflight magazine, or preferably, by restoring this purchase option.

My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody.

Nearly missed my eastbound Phoenix connection and actually did miss my westbound connecting Phoenix flight due to late departure from NYC. My Westbound flight took nearly 11 hours from NYC to Oakland. I could have flown to Europe in that amount of time (less actually). Promised meal eastbound was not provided after all.

11691,16523,etihad-airways,Barbara Crawford,United Kingdom,EY460 9th March from Manchester to Abu Dhabi. This was my first long haul flight so wasn't exactly sure how it would be. Excellent flight with very attentive service comfortable seats and good inflight entertainment. 2nd leg of journey from Abu Dhabi quite poor in comparison. At Abu Dhabi airport was sent to the wrong lounge and no one seemed to have information on our flight details. Lounge very busy. Once onboard the flight staff initially helpful but that soon wore off. Was offered a drink which I accepted only to have it taken away unfinished with no explanation. Obviously an older plane not the one shown on the website and the seats were a bit worn. I hadn't realised that the flight was with an Etihad partner Virgin. I chose to travel business class for the reason that Etihad have flat beds some help with how to flatten them would have been good. Most people sleeping presume this was the reason there was no meal offered? I had to ask for breakfast I don't really consider a bowl of cornflakes a round of toast or a steak sandwich on a 13 hour flight acceptable. The cost of this flight was £3400 I could probably have a few nights in a five star hotel for that.

5471,7528,ana-all-nippon-airways,T Ugasucia,United States,This review is for an economy class NRT-JFK trip. First off I would recommend ANA when flying to the US because overall the inflight experience is excellent thanks to the fabulous cabin crew. So much better than dealing with any of the US carriers and their surly service. However my numerous experiences with the ground staff at Narita airport makes me absolutely dread the return leg of my trip between NY and TYO. The check-in process is so confusing and takes so long. All the agents seem to be either new or have no concept of processing passengers quickly. It always takes 20 minutes from the time I reach the counter to when I leave it. Despite being polite and smiling the agents don't really give good advice and are not very helpful to be quite honest. If it weren't for the great cabin crew I'd rate the staff service as very poor. Inflight the economy class seats on the B777-300 are uncomfortable because of the head rest that juts out pushes my head forward so I'm sitting with my chin on my neck. I noticed a lot of passengers sleeping with their heads resting on the tray tables probably because of this. The economy class meals are just horrible. I have learned to buy or pack my own. The drink selections are good. The inflight entertainment is mediocre especially their music selection.,Economy,6,2,3,2,2,3,8,2014,1
11179,15945,etihad-airways,Joshua Soo,Malaysia,"Flew on this airline on 2 legs, first is from KUL to AUH on a Virgin Australia B777 aircraft (EY411) with a VA crew. Seat is quite spacious and crew is rather decent as well and that goes to the food too. Only complaint is the IFE system which couldn't be turned on for the first hour of the flight but the crew did a good job at managing it by regularly updating on what they will be doing to resolve this. Next leg is on EY73 from AUH to ZRH on an Etihad A330 (EY73). All the reviews about seat being cramped in Economy are definitely true but I would say it's not totally unbearable given that I've sat on seats with similar width and legroom before. But I must say the amount of things they give to you (blanket + amenities kit + inflight magazine + duty free mag) does make the space more cramped than usual as you need somewhere to keep all the items in. Contrary to most reviews though, the crew is quite okay though maybe not as friendly as what you have on SQ or MH. ",Economy,7,3,3,3,4,4,6,2015,1
17142,25445,lufthansa,Dirk Toebben,Germany,My preferred airline to keep my status (SEN). I like the fact that they welcome to you personally aboard as a senator. This was not done on this trip however. The next space in the economy is not all that great but that is probably true for most deadlines. What I do not like about Lufthansa is that they have greatly reduce their miles earnings on certain flights as of this year. If my chances to renew my status were further reduced I would probably look into other airlines more often as well. On this trip I had a nice seat in the exit row. Unfortunately I had a huge guy sitting next to me so it was all cramped in anyway. In addition the baby across the aisle cried the entire night however these are not Lufthansa's fault of course.

Attentive service great seat (flat bed) and AVOD with 20 or so current movies. Tip: spread the duvet out on the seat and sleep on top of it as the cushions are very firm. On landing in Beijing we had to transfer from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. Instructions were clear but we couldn't locate the shuttle and walked the distance between Terminals. If you are young this is no problem. If old and creaky like us it is a long walk. Flight from PEK to PVG was ordinary 737 with standard ""first class"" recliners as would be found in domestic flights in the U.S. The return leg from PVG to PEK was the same as the outbound but once arriving in PEK we were met by a gate agent herded to a bus and taken from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. Along the way we gathered our bags then rechecked them. That saved us a lot of wandering through corridors dragging luggage. I was surprised to realize that our 787 flight boarded off-terminal it was a long bus ride out to the plane. Once on board however the champagne arrived and all was well. Food on the return trip seemed fresher and the flight attendants were much more capable and attentive - more like Asiana than a regional Chinese airline.

8033,11240,british-airways,D Remnant,United Kingdom,London Gatwick to Orlando. No surprises to guess that as our original flight to Tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. Due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. After finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the BA system for an unexplained reason. What an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. After accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day BA then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. Our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from Heathrow to Charlotte to Tampa. We did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for a flight instead to Orlando. A longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. We arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. To add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us!

Seating and legroom were equivalent to regular AC flights (I am 5 '11"") and the food was even a bit better quality (although portions were slightly smaller). Wifi-based entertainment system seems to be Apple-centric and did not work properly with my Android tablet although movies were shown on the overhead screens.

10241,14779,egyptair,V Gavrou,Greece,ATH-BKK-ATH via CAI. Booked with Egyptair because it was the only flight available (code share with Thai airways). The ATH-CAI-ATH legs were quite good. Helpful and pleasant crew good food good planes. CAI-BKK also adequate my seat was faulty but all in all a satisfactory flight. BKK-CAI was the worst flight experience. A very old 777 it gave you the impression it would fall apart old broken dirty seats not even a foot rest no screens not even lights working to read. It is unacceptable a StarAlliance member to use such old planes in long flights. Toilets dirty crew not helpful. I had to go and find an attendant two times to get some water. I will definitely try to avoid flying with EgyptAir in the future.,Economy,3,1,3,4,1,2,5,2014,0

They offered from the menu ""Onboard Cafe"" against payment. Since the flight was only a bit more than 1.5 hours the sandwich was ok. Flight back 30 minutes delayed - not the airlines fault. Again very nice and attentive crew same sort of sandwich offered on the way back. For short flights Air Berlin is fine.",Economy,8,4,5,3,0,4,7,2013,1

A passenger seated next to me spilled her orange juice on my lap and they courteously offered wet towels to me when I requested for them. Food was great and Krisworld was amazing as usual.,Economy,10,4,5,5,5,4,7,2014,1
17438,25803,malaysia-airlines,Martin Gomez,India,Travelled COK-KUL-MEL MH129 Oct 2013. The 737-800 on the COK-KUL sector was congested but the 777 on the KUL-MEL sector was okay. Inflight service was perhaps the worst we have encountered. The catering was most noticeable as meals were insufficient and no choice of drinks. Malaysia Airlines is cost cutting even on tea and coffee. I suppose you get what you pay for. Will never travel Malaysia Airlines again.,Economy,1,1,1,1,3,1,10,2013,0
11321,16099,etihad-airways,Brian Nick,Ireland,Return flights from KUL-AUH-DUB on January 12th. Boarding in KL was hassle free and quick. Flight was with Jet Airways at 2.30am took off on time and light snack served. Cabin light dimmed until 2 hours before landing however flight attendants brought regular drinks through the cabin. Breakfast was fine as was entertainment. Flight attendants were professional but not overly friendly. Boarding for flight to Dublin was chaotic to say the least. Only one person dealing with approx 300 passengers until eventually 3 more arrived. Suddenly we had 4 chiefs and no one willing to do the basics of checking people through. Words cannot describe the inefficiency of what was happening. This meant after a bus ride to plane we were an hour late taking off. Welcomed on board by name by the flight attendant at top of steps. This set the tone for the flight with smiling attendants who were very obliging to every request. Food was fine and again regular drinks brought through cabin. Overall an ok experience apart from the disaster that is Abu Dhabi airport.,Economy,7,4,5,5,5,5,1,2015,1
26482,40032,virgin-australia,K Watkins,Australia,I travelled on Flight VA 1179 from Albury to Sydney on the evening of Friday 22 November. We were delayed leaving and then had to detour to Canberra due to the severe storms in Sydney. We finally landed in Sydney at about 8.45 but were unable to disembark until just before 10pm due to the huge backlog of planes trying to disembark. During the 5 hours we were on the plane I must congratulate the young cabin crew particularly the young lady who tried to keep us all informed as the delays continued. They were both very professional even when a few male passengers were very rude demanding to get off and refusing to stay seated. The young lady ended up in tears but was thanked by most as we disembarked. I congratulate them both for keeping their cool as the situation was not the airlines fault.,Economy,5,3,5,3,2,3,11,2013,1
14929,22375,jetstar-airways,Bronwyn Hughes,Australia,Flew CNS-BNE return over weekend. (6-7 September). I booked Jetstar due the the cheap flights on offer. I purchased a bundle which came with a food voucher and choice of seat and QFF and was happy with the value. Big points on being able to order hot food now (ham and cheese toastie or pieface box). Check in times were satisfactory. Staff were friendly. Nothing exceptional but more then adequate. I would love to see the food menu extended even if I have to pre-order prior to boarding. Seat pitch okay but a bit confining when the seat in front reclined but again budget airline so it is what it is.,Economy,8,4,5,4,1,5,9,2014,1

We didn't wait for a long time in Singapore to proceed on our next flight going to FRA. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music, games.  They serve delicious meals and always asking passenger if they need something.

10516,15204,emirates,J Fox,Ireland,DUB-DBX-PEK and return. Four Emirates Flights in the last 6 days. First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly abrupt extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional courteous caring and engaging throughout. The PEK-DBX flight epitomised the standard for exemplary customer service in every way albeit helped by the fantastic A380-800 aircraft used on this sector. Despite the first let-down Emirates will be my airline of choice for any future longhaul international travel.,Economy,9,5,5,5,4,5,4,2015,1
943,1463,aer-lingus,J McKerney,United Kingdom,Just returned home from Lanzarote to Belfast on Saturday 25th August and was shocked about the level of customer care given. The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them! Everything else about the trip was smooth but the journey home just completely spoilt it hence the low scores.,Economy,5,4,2,3,0,4,8,2012,0

13856,19893,icelandair,J Saville,Canada,We chose bulkhead seats in Saga class not knowing there were no foot rests. Since I have serious leg problems I need to have my legs raised somewhat during most of the flight. There was nothing to put my feet on. The staff were excellent allowing me to use my carry on for support but this was not adequate. I had trouble walking the entire visit to the UK. I am dreading the flight home. We had to wait in Toronto and Iceland plane was late leaving no place to sit in Iceland airport so had to stand for 30 minutes. No boarding preference were discouraged from using the lounge because of distance to walk from gate. No indication on ticket or booking regarding dinner service. The only difference from economy was the wider seat. I will have to fly home but never again.,Business Class,5,2,5,5,0,3,9,2013,0
3250,4334,air-france,C Wajsberg,Israel,JNB-CDG-TLV in economy on 17th October. Even if I had 3 seats for myself flying in economy on this A380 is not any better when it comes to comfort of seat compared with other airlines. Crew were very good and helped as much as they could. Food was ok even if appetiser was of poor quality. Most of all I appreciated the new breakfast concept in economy a warm crepe with a very sweet sauce. Small bread roll and croissant jam and some fresh fruit salad usual breakfast drinks. Much better then cold cuts and cheese with some dry bread roll and fruit compote we used to receive well done AF nice improvement. CDG-TLV same service as usual and as early morning flight out of CDG we received what to me looks like a very poor breakfast but food on European flights is always poor.,Economy,9,2,4,4,5,4,10,2013,1
16330,24429,malaysia-airlines,Yeoh Khong Wooi,Malaysia,PEN-KUL-PEN. Booked Malaysia Airlines through travel agency at a low price. I was surprised by the generous leg room offered by MAS and it is wider than any widebody jet operated by Cathay Thai Dragonair etc. However on the first leg the cabin required more attention some food stains from earlier flights were left. The entertainment system works fine but on the return flight the IFE failed abruptly after both engines started. Other than that the cabin crew seemed disinterested in serving passengers on Penang to KL route while crew members on my returning flight were much friendlier. Overall the airline product was good.,Economy,9,5,3,3,2,5,5,2015,1

When I said I might ""volunteer"" to give up my seat she asked what the code for Nashville is. Agent came on and off the plane a dozen times before we finally left 15 minutes late. Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure.

Flying on American is tough enough but if you have an American Eagle leg in your trip you are likely to face delays slow baggage service and attitudes that are even worse than that of other American employees.

14301,20690,jet-airways,P Duende,Canada,We went on a one-week vacation to beautiful Samana. Upon arrival to the Ottawa Airport we couldn't check in using my husbands passport due to WestJet making a mistake on his name. A very nice representative helped us at Ottawa airport to check in using my passport. On the flight from Toronto to Samana I ended up in the middle seat besides a drunken passenger who just shut the window blind down and spent the entire trip sleeping and invading my personal space. Those planes are small so having to fight off your little space with another passenger is draining. My husband sitting on the alley chair had half his elbow bumped several times by one of the flight attendants. The plane was smelly but at least it wasn't visibly dirty this time. In-flight food: Their free offerings were the poorest I've had the displeasure of experiencing: tiny glasses of water/soft drink/coffee and just two 14 grams bags of cookies or sesame sticks for a 4 hours flight. I understand this was supposed to be a value flight but it wasn't the least expensive in the bunch when compared with Air Canada offerings. All the above mentioned would have been forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the nightmarish experience we had on our flight back. As stated we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport once there we were given two seats together (window and middle): all nice until we got on the flight. The seats were not reclining and we had not been informed. Once the people in front of us reclined we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant thinking there was a way of reclining but she just said it was not possible in a rushed manner as if we were a nuisance. For four hours we had to sit uncomfortably with our knees being constantly banged by the hyper kids sitting in front of us and without any possibility of rest. I do believe that if the airline is going to take away a passengers right to a reclining chair/cabin space they should at least offer some kind of compensation be it in the way of a pillow for their sore-necks or a food voucher. To make things worse the cabin on the flight back to Toronto was extremely dirty. The smell could be catalogued more as a stench. The cherry on top was that our connection to Ottawa was delayed for 30 minutes or more due to WestJet having a flight from Cancun being delayed also so we ended up missing our bus connection at the airport.,Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,2014,0
16438,24544,malindo-air,Karamdeep Singh Satwant Singh,Australia,Flew on August 14 to Delhi in business class. Return flight on 22nd also in business. Outstanding crew very efficient and helpful. Crew were happy for a chat. Food was great with Hagen Daz as ice cream for dessert which was a surprise. They also provided us with hot towel and peanuts for a snack with pre departure drinks. The premium lounge in Delhi airport was basic but comfortable and nice. The seats are comfortable for a 737. Overall will certainly fly Malindo again.,Business Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,9,2014,1
25996,39458,vietnam-airlines,M Hay,Australia,SGN-SYD. This flight was part of an itinerary from Paris to Sydney. Vietnam Airlines offers a free transit program to eligible ticket holders (you need to book it 72 hours beforehand) - which we used and strongly recommend - we had a 14 hour transit between flights - we were met when we got off the plane and our visas were arranged we were then taken to an inner city hotel and had lunch and dinner and a tour of the city and then we were taken back to airport. It was a very pleasant way to spend the day and a nice break between the flights - also there was no extra money to pay and it took care of the hassle of organising a Vietnam visa. The A330-200 flight was half an hour late (all the flights I have taken out of SGN have been late) and was about 40% full in business class which was just as well because we had problems with three seats - entertainment not working necessitating multiple seat changes. Food was acceptable (not as good as the SYD-SGN leg) but the champagne was nice no refills were ever offered but the friendly staff responded quickly to the call button. The seat doesn't go completely horizontal but is pretty comfortable and sleep was possible. Entertainment options were pretty much limited to a reasonable selection of movies and not much else. No priority card given for customs/security at Sydney airport. Overall the flight went quickly and I was comfortable enough. I will fly Vietnam airlines again.,Business Class,7,4,4,3,3,4,6,2014,1
19704,29207,qatar-airways,Y Tomlinson,United Kingdom,LHR to DOH en-route to Perth. This plane seemed very new it had a good touchscreen TV and a little tablet in the seat. Good movie options clear screen and sound. Seats were comfortable and roomy I also had 2 seats to myself which helped. Service was good the food was ok offered plenty and had some lovely bruschetta in-between meals. Boarded a different plane from DOH to PER this was definitely an older plane. I was in an aisle seat and it was the most uncomfortable plane I've been on. Staff never smiled and when you asked for a drink they seemed annoyed. The food wasn't that good. On the return I had an 11 hour PER to DOH and this only bearable because I luckily had a row to myself so lay down and slept. Again staff never smiled and there was only one girl who was friendly. On the next 7 hour flight to LHR I was absolutely freezing! So much so I had to ask for a 2nd blanket.,Economy,4,2,2,3,3,3,3,2014,0

There was no Elite service and the line up was extremely long. It took over an hour and a half to get to the counter to receive my boarding pass. It seemed very disorganized. Then the passengers were rushed through the security section ducking under the line barriers as the flight was being called. I have flown many times with Sunwing and I must say I was very disappointed with the service on this flight.,Economy,1,2,4,3,1,1,3,2015,0

I flew today from Belgrade to Malpensa (flight from Milan to Belgrade I did with Alitalia with a stopover in Rome) although given my previous experience with JAT I wanted to avoid it at all costs. The plane I got onto was neatly furbished quite comfortable economy class seats great catering for a short-haul flight very warm attitude from the crew.

Interesting airplane (TU204) and very likely the first and last time I fly a Russian built plane (not a lot operated where I spend most of my time). Flight to North-hard and bumpy landing. Back to Beijing was good - not so many turns and much smoother. Once we arrived in Pyongyang immigration took 10 mins and bags were delivered immediately.

4743,6470,air-transat,S Burtt,United Kingdom,Glasgow to Toronto Return. Far better than expected. As a long term back pain sufferer I never travel any distance unless I have to. However I found this flight far more comfortable than any of the short distance flights I've taken flying from Glasgow to London the Midlands or Exeter. On this flight I walked away almost pain free. Most seats are in a 3+3+3 configuration which gives a very narrow aisle. I was careful to book an aisle seat in the rear of the cabin with its 2+3+2 configuration giving more space. The in-flight films were a bit naff but who cares. Take your own earphones if you want to watch the films. The meals were small and basic but again so what as long as the seats are good. If you want to buy anything you need a credit card as they don't take cash. A slight criticism was that I didn't realise that soft drinks were free until the return flight. Staff don't make that clear.,Economy,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,2012,1

I did take the time to read the information that Spirit publishes on their website so there were no surprises for us. Beginning with our arrival at the New Orleans airport their employees were all most courteous helpful and this extended throughout both the originating and return flights. Spirit sells you what you want and does not sell you what you don't want or need. We paid for the equivalent of first class seats as well as checked bags and still came out hundreds of dollars less than the cost of first class service on any other airline. Both flights were smooth and on time. The flight crews did a very good job of getting everyone on board and ready to go on time. We would not hesitate to fly them again.

My next leg was MEX to TIJ in a B737-700 old cramped no inflight entertainment just one tiny bag of peanuts for a 3 hour flight toilet old and dirty. The boarding procedure AM is implementing is awful and useless. It takes longer and it is absurd. First they board pax on window seats then center seats and on final call aisle seats no matter if you are in row 10 or 24. Uncomfortable at the gates.

26612,40222,virgin-atlantic-airways,C Batchelor,United Kingdom,Overnight from JFK to London Heathrow was one of the worst transatlantic flights I have taken. In economy there is so little leg room that all passengers are woken up for every drink and meal service and required to put their seats up right regardless if they wanted refreshments or not. On a 7 hour flight with 2 or 3 services this left only 3 hours to sleep uninterrupted. Not impressed Virgin Atlantic.

The captain made frequent announcements and updated us on any progress made. Very smooth flight with brilliant landing and takeoff. Crew were really friendly and helpful throughout. Outbound fantastic. TFS-MAN B787-800. The dreamliner aircraft was out of this world. It really puts the customer at heart and fuels all the senses. We departed on time and landed on time.

Outbound flights were cancelled without us being informed. Was offered the routing BOD-LGW then a coach transfer to LHR at our own expense followed by LHR-JFK then JFK-SJU on American domestic. I did not think this was a reasonable re-routing. Finally offered ORY-MAD-SJU with Iberia. We checked in and given Fast Track security pass and went directly to the lounge. When the flight was ready for boarding we were escorted by a member of staff to Fast Track security and onto the boarding gate where we had priority boarding. Greeted by the Captain and cabin crew. Pre-departure drinks served and we departed on time. The breakfast meal was fine and we arrived in Madrid early and transferred directly to the Iberia lounge. Directed to the boarding gate where we were given priority boarding and were quickly settled into the spacious cabin. Pre flight drinks served and after departure the Purser came around and took our meal orders. There then followed a drinks service with nuts. We both enjoyed our food and the excellent wines on offer. After the meal I reclined the seat and had a good sleep before watching a film - the choice was limited as an English speaker but perfectly adequate. 90 mins out of SJU given a light meal and bar service. Arrived 10 mins early and were swiftly off the aircraft. Our bags were amongst the first off the carrousel. A very pleasant flight.,Business Class,10,5,5,5,3,5,12,2012,1

With just five in Business Class we were treated like royalty on this plane that was literally a month old. The staff were well trained friendly and very engaged. The Luke Mangan menu was just divine and the FA's had extensive knowledge of food and wine pairings. Nice little touches like a well stocked amenity kit noise cancelling headphones comfortable and well designed seats and an extensive wine list made me not want to get off the flight.

A330 airbus seating was not bad even had AVOD (although mine didn't work). For a 90 min flight all I got was a tiny hot dog wrapped in foil (not on a tray) a small cup of water only one round of tea not even coffee. Absolutely no other drinks offered. It felt like a budget airlines although the ticket price matches other carriers such as Dragon air or CX. Service was lukewarm. On return the plane was even smaller they served a hot dog again very stingy indeed but I was prepared this time by eating before boarding. No IFE only overhead TV.

Due to technical reasons the PG-146 was delayed by over 3 hours. On arrival at BKK we were met by a Bangkok Airways representative who took us by car to the terminal to try to reach in time for the AI flight. However the AI counter was closed by the time we reached it. However Bangkok Airways could arrange for us to get seats (flight was full so we had to wait till the counter closed) on PG-733 to Mumbai. All the time the Bangkok Airways representative was with us. We appreciate all the help given to us by Bangkok Airway ground staff at Bangkok and have no hesitation in recommending the airline in spite of delayed flight from Koh-Samui.,Economy,10,4,5,4,3,4,5,2013,1
10419,15003,el-al-israel-airlines,S Kaczur,United States,JFK-TLV TLV-JFK 747-400 rows 25 and 26 seats a/b/c. The cabin definitely showed its age but appeared clean. Lavatories were also clean and remained so for the duration of our long flight. Service on board was not overly warm or friendly but certainly adequate and responsive. On the outbound quite a few seats open in Economy Plus section a couple of rows in front of us and the flight attendant offered to let my husband sit there so my son could lie down across 2 rows and sleep. Food was adequate for economy class (but no alcoholic beverages offered except for red wine). On the outbound my seat cushion in 26A was loose and there was a big gap in the back exposing crayons and a number of other little goodies left over from previous flights. On the return we sat in row 25 just behind Economy Plus. When the people in front of us reclined they may as well have been sitting in our laps! Good for them regarding the recline horrible for us. Speaking of recline my seat and my son's seat would not stay reclined and I kept having to adjust them. Entertainment system completely antiquated and limited! Thankfully I had a good book to read and it was a night flight! Overall I would probably not fly El Al again until they update their equipment into the 21st century.,Economy,5,2,3,3,1,2,7,2013,0

As a Star Alliance Gold with A3 following security checks I was able to use the Club Lounge facilities. Being morning items for a continental type breakfast were available. The lounge was however very busy. The flight boarded on time and departed 30 minutes late due to airport operational issues at FLL. (out of the control of UA) Orders for breakfast were taken prior to departure (2 choices) and delivered in a friendly way while en-route.

Because of a death in the family I had to alter my return trip and (although the waiting time on the phone was longish) the response was warm understanding and accommodating for my change in plans. The negative about ANA is that it codeshares with United (a terrible airline) out of New York so the long leg from NY to Tokyo is suffered with bad food costly drinks and lousy service. It was paradise to change to an all ANA crew and flight in Tokyo. We are now going to fly out of Chicago to avoid Untied and go ANA all the way.,Economy,10,4,5,4,5,5,8,2014,1

27273,41180,virgin-atlantic-airways,A Sheppard,United Kingdom,Manchester to Orlando and back. Economy seats are the most uncomfortable I have encountered. Food was also the worst that my husband and I have ever had on an airline. The portions were small and you got the feeling that this was the cheapest meal that Virgin could order. The 'breakfast' coming back was 'muffin tops' granola bar and a small bit of juice. So basically sugar sugar and more sugar. I don't expect bacon and eggs in economy but even a good quality croissant with some butter would have been better. Served no tea and coffee as they said there was a 'problem' out of Manchester. This flight left Orlando so not sure why they couldn't order supplies out of Orlando. The only thing good I can say was that I thought the inflight entertainment was good and that the crew were attentive. It's not their fault that they were serving the cheapest of cheap catering. I thought on both legs that they regularly came around with water/juice during the flight. I would only fly Virgin again if there were no other choice.,Economy,2,1,4,1,4,1,7,2013,0

Not happy with the booking system as it tries to sell you everything from Hot Seats to Baggage to Insurance etc. and every time we book we have to be careful to delete all these items as it gives you Hot seats to charge you more. Other airlines leave it to you to add on items you wan to purchase and this is more practical. They should make their booking system more User Friendly!

I hate flying and have to know as much about airline I am travelling with and even then am really scared. This year we are flying with them again - and although still scared of flying I know the cabin crew will be once again as helpful as before.

20328,30390,sas-scandinavian-airlines,R Inque,Japan,Flew from Narita/Tokyo to Copenhagen. The aircraft was old and everything was outdated. Blankets are filthy (lot of hair on the blanket) and entertainment screen resolution is horrible.. I didn't know it still exists but SAS entertainment isn't on-demand so you hope for the best and catch a movie that has just started. For a long haul like Asia-Europe (11.5 hours) it's just unbelievable. Cabin crews didn't even check who ordered special meals and they handed over meals to the wrong people. You have to pay for alcohol beverages (not that I care but again it is an intercontinental flight!) and each meal is very minimal. I compare SAS to other European airlines that operate between Asia and Europe and I definitely think SAS tickets are overpriced. Although Finnair isn't the best their flights are shorter and service is better and there isn't much difference in price.,Economy,1,2,2,2,1,1,3,2014,0
4292,5801,airasia,Rohit Thukral,United States,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.,Premium Economy,1,2,1,2,1,3,10,2013,0

While the check-in and airport facilities in SXB provides no benefits (e.g. no lounge not even a voucher) for C-Class passengers MAD airport is clean easy to navigate and the IB-lounges (T4 and T4S) are very nice roomy with good food and drinks (wine). Connecting flights to MAD were operated by Air Nostrum in small Canadair jets. I liked the flights and even the catering was very good; even better than on the last leg with IB from MIA to MAD. FA on the Air Nostrum flights were very nice and service orientated. We were happy to have the new A330 on the MAD-MIA-MAD sectors and I have to say that the seat is one of the most comfortable I ever experienced in any C-class. IFE is good and has a large screen. FA's were nice and helpful on the MAD-MIA sector not so on MIA-MAD. Drinks are extensive with nice wines especially the red ones. Food was so-so. The only thing I would consider for IB is the long process before serving dinner on the late-night departure for the MIA-MAD leg. One wants to sleep as fast as possible on such legs eastbound but it took them over 2 hours to complete first service and switch off the lights. Furthermore breakfast was minimal (no choices).

6074,8392,american-airlines,R Paterson,United States,RDU-LHR return in Y. Outbound check-in and bag check handled smoothly no complaints. Boarding somewhat chaotic but this was mainly due to the layout of the gate area. Aircraft on this route are older 763s with no IFE but seats and toilets seemed in decent condition. Food decent enough and FAs - while not terribly friendly - were diligent about offering drinks. Entertainment was pretty miserable but what do you expect when you have no seatback system and have to rely on the overheads? Pretty laughable for an international leg. Return flight check- in at LHR was a breeze but boarding was infuriating! Pax with group 3/4 boarding passes rushing the gate during pre-boarding gate attendants barely speaking above a whisper when announcing boarding groups. Really ridiculous. FAs on return flight much friendlier. Main Cabin Extra proved worthwhile as the legroom was plentiful.

Very disappointed as my ordered vegetarian meal was missing even though I had double checked and had confirmation that it was ordered when checking in my luggage before boarding. So on my return trip I checked and had confirmation again that it had been ordered. This time my vegetarian meal turned out to be an ""Asian vegetarian"" meal a curry instead of my ""normal vegetarian meal of pasta! Normally I would accept this but as I can't eat curries at all I pointed the mistake out to a cabin crew who said they would check. I waited and no one came back to me so while they started serving everyone else's meal and passed me without a word I asked again about my normal vegetarian meal of pasta and not Asian vegetarian. Couldn't believe it when the same curry as before was given to me again. Obviously the crew didn't listen to what I had said or couldn't care less at all. To top it all of I later found out from my husband sitting 3 seats away from me with our 2 children between us that they had tried to put the mistake down to me because I had asked for a Asian vegetarian meal myself when in fact I had specifically asked for a normal one of pasta as per menu after the first mistake.",Economy,1,3,1,1,3,1,9,2014,0

However staff had no idea about where we should go when we landed and I insisted that they were wrong about where they were sending us as we were having a one night layover. However staff insisted that we take the bus and get off at the Premium Lounge. This was of course wrong and we had to wait for a new bus to take us to immigration. Several movies were not showing on the plane but still it was ok. Personally I do prefer Emirates as they seem to have better entertainment onboard and better service.

No personal entertainment screen which is terrible considering it's a 13 hour flight. Food is OK but the portions are way too small. The only thing that could have redeemed this airline was if their cabin crews are friendly and hospitable enough - but they aren't. There were Malaysian passengers who were requesting the vegetarian meal but they did not request it online / before the flight. Ideally an airline should be prepared for such situations. It was very disappointing how the cabin crew handled such thing. Makes me wonder what kind of training they undergo. They should learn a lot from Singapore airlines crew.

The food inflight entertainment bar etc are not important to us our priorities are lounge access frequent flyer miles and onboard space which we are happy to pay a premium for. However we did feel that the Upper Class suite on their A330 aircraft is now smaller in width and length and the aisles are very narrow when compared to the 747 that used to operate to and from St Lucia.

Business Class travel is a rare treat for us and I can't understand why BA persevere with this unique forwards/backwards facing seating layout. To sit for 11 hours face to face with a stranger is awful as is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seats. The cabin crew were great food was below average and the inflight entertainment system abysmal: poor choice and terrible picture quality. Outbound we were upstairs on a 747 there were two attendants assisting only 16 passengers and they did a good job and kept the two toilets clean. Given these circumstances this flight experience should have been fantastic. However given the negatives detailed above I would classify it as just about average.

956,1487,air-berlin,Roger Stone,Australia,Milan-Berlin-Antalya and return via Dusseldorf: a reasonably enjoyable experience although Berlin Tegel was possibly the worst 'airport experience' I can remember for a long time especially as I had a 4 hour layover stuck in what seemed like a make-shift demountable building plus use of a few old steel chairs. Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time). Priority luggage does not appear to be recognised. All in all quite a pretty good experience and which reminded me for the benefit of my fellow countrymen very much like some of the better Jetstar flights and experiences in Australia.,Economy,7,5,4,4,0,4,4,2014,1
26655,40279,virgin-australia,A Black,Australia,Sydney-Perth Saturday afternoon service. Unfortunately the weekend flights use the older aircraft and not the new Airbus A330s with lie flat seats. Cabin manager is assigned to business class only (4 passengers) and was attentive upon boarding hanging my jacket and offering beverages with a choice of water or a mocktail there was no champagne or sparkling to be seen. After take off we were offered beverages and our meal orders were taken. The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way. After waiting 15 minutes for them to disburse I stepped through the curtain only to be told that I couldn't be up there and to return to my seat. A few minutes later I was approached by the cabin manager to explain that the first officer was coming out of the cockpit and that is why I was told to return to my seat. I wasn't happy with how they handled the situation. The amenities kit was good however it was not handed out until half way through the flight. Overall it was a pretty disappointing the best part of the trip was the priority baggage.,Business Class,5,4,3,4,1,2,8,2013,0

I was taking ANA flight from Tokyo to Seattle but the flight was cancelled due to the suspension of 787 so they signed me to another United flight. Their apology was really sincere. On this flight the seat was comfortable with a fair pitch and recline the IFE was friendly with mostly Japanese movies and some Hollywood movies. Games and TV programmes were good.

The business class lounge at the international PAL terminal has been totally refurbished compared to the one I saw in November 2012. Its modern clean comfortable the food and drinks selection is good. En route to Bangkok by coincidence we have been embarked into an A321 maiden flight. Being a 3.5 hrs trip and a day flight comfort is not as important as for the long haul ones. However the seating was narrow without any leg rest no power sockets and no inflight entertainment which is awkward for a brand new plane of latest generation. After we took off we have been given iPads which did the job with a wide selection of movies and inflight electronic entertainment. On the way back I have been boarded into an A340 former Iberia but the experience in this case was excellent compared to the outbound route. Lie flatbed powered seats inflight entertainment (although the selection was limited to just one movie) and good service onboard. Must throw a huge commend for the attendants fantastic attentive professional all of them. Concluding for mid-short flight the experience its ok. Considering that the airline came out from tough times in the recent past it is fair to say that they did a good recovery job but from a passenger point of view there is certainly room for improvement except for the cabin crew which clearly stand out compared to most other competitors even if big names.,Business Class,7,3,5,4,3,3,10,2013,1

My previous longest flights have been in the six hour range to and from European destinations while my Etihad flights were in the 12 hour range. I'm 6' 3"" tall so legroom is always an important consideration. The legroom on Etihad wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad either. When the passenger in front of me fully reclined my knees were just touching the seatback on an Air Canada flight several years ago I had to contort because of the lack of legroom on a flight from France to Canada. Regarding inflight entertainment there were enough movies and TV shows to keep me going when I wasn't dozing. I also really enjoyed the food as there was a selection of Indian cuisine throughout and I was never at a loss for drink including wine. On my return flight before we took off we had to return to the gate because of a sick passenger; this delayed things by about an hour and a half causing me to miss a connection in Toronto.

Air Canada Rouge happily accepted my money and emitted the corresponding receipt but on obtaining my boarding pass I discovered I had been reassigned to 15A which on boarding the plane I discovered was a normal ""meat packer"" seat while someone else had been given 18F. It turns out that their business practice is to sell those seats to anyone but they only actually assign them to passengers at the check-in counter. To avoid a repeat we showed up for our return flight 10 minutes before the check-in counter opened. We were first in line yet my reserved and paid for extra-legroom seat had already been assigned to someone else. This is shoddy way to do business. I can understand that seats on the emergency aisle should only be assigned to passengers who will be able to help if they are called upon to operate the emergency door (something which I am perfectly able to do) and therefore should only be assigned at check-in but that being the case why allow someone to pay for and reserve one in advance when the reality is that they are assigned on a first come first serve basis by the staff at the check-in counter?",Economy,2,1,1,1,1,2,5,2015,0

As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but I did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours.

20434,30611,scoot,L Y Chiew,Australia,Flew from Singapore to Sydney on 29/1/13. Check in was slow - one of the ground staff collected our passports and about another 5 people at front of the queue took them back to the counter the person at the counter flipped through the passports put a sticker on the front and then the passports were returned. Yet when our turn came to check in there was no apparent time saving. The check in staff were inappropriately dressed they were indistinguishable from general airport workers. Onboard we had ordered the blanket sets and had to ask 3 times for them although they did apologise when we finally received them. The overhead reading light switches on the arm were very sensitive so that every time you press against the arm the light would come on. The inflight crew were polite and helpful.,Economy,6,3,3,4,0,3,2,2013,0

Lounge was basic but I guess it is normal since they have only European flights from Terminal 2F. Boarding as usual is chaotic but Priority boarding announcement was still made less than a minute before general boarding was called. Once on board fantastic friendly and elegant purser welcomed and greeted passengers. For the price of the ticket the catering was awful with cold tasteless amuse bouche served. Seats are all the same across all cabins with 2 rows of business class (2 passengers sharing 3 seats) and a row of premium economy class (3 passengers on 3 seats) then a curtain separating economy class which gives an extremely cramped and stressful feeling. The cabin crew did their best but honestly the hard product let everything down.,Business Class,5,2,4,1,1,1,8,2013,1

Gave the usual lame excuses. I decided on this flight as it was direct. There were cheaper options but this was more convenient. The seats are definitely more comfortable than their older planes. They can't bring themselves to actually give you anything - not even a cup of tea on a 9 hour ride. It's a nickel and dimes show always. I paid quite a bit for their ""entertainment"" package but this was a rip off. Not much on offer. You would be better off loading up a few sticks and bringing your laptop or iPad.

Twice we took off from Denver and both times we were re-routed back. The only information we got was a two second message from the pilot that we were going back. We were completely on our own to find out what we were supposed to do. None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question.

The flight attendants were very helpful though, they brought me a vegetarian meal that was not claimed for one meal and for the second one they put together a meal for me - mostly salads, fruit, and nuts.

We were scheduled to depart at 8pm from Terminal 8 (American/One World but Air Berlin plane still at our gate). It had snowed earlier that day so flights were being cancelled or delayed however the LAN flight was still being shown on the departure information board as being on time. The young lady from LAN also told me that the flight was on time. We finally took off at 11pm after being de-iced. In the air LAN was very good in the past I used American to MVD from New York (via Miami) and the difference between the two airlines in the air was like night and day. The FA's were friendly young and interacted with the passengers. Missed connection in SCL but LAN had rebooked me on later flight to MVD and also gave me a voucher for food as my flight was not until mid afternoon. Flight to MVD on A320 the seats seemed to be wider than on the 787 and also a bit more leg room. Coming back from MVD to JFK everything was OK until departure from SCL. We were scheduled to depart at 11pm but due to full load plus many families with kids we did not take off until midnight. Again service and food in the air was excellent (2 entree choices at dinner and breakfast). We were scheduled to arrive at 8am into JFK as we began our descent the pilot announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather and we were being diverted to EWR. We landed at 9.30am waited for an hour to get a gate in Terminal B went through Immigration and then waited an hour and a half for luggage.

The flight attendants on too many of my recent flights are also grumbling and service is sketchy at best.

The A330s on MNL-SIN-MNL are new, with comfortable seats and a little more legroom, compared to A380s on SIN-CDG-SIN. In the A380s, seats are cramped. Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls  are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They ""manage"" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let's them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier.

I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a low’ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since.

It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked.

Stewardess's were extremely friendly/helpful. Both legs were full/ had plenty of babies and demanding patrons (constantly pressing call buttons even during meal service) but they took it in stride and always came straight away with a smile. Yes if you want a meal you have to pay extra but they've always made that quite clear when you buy your tickets which re price I find extremely competitive for long distance international so I've never had an issue with that. They also take cash on-board (this flight Euro or Krone) which I've never experienced on a international or domestic flight before. Economy has a bit more leg room but this is achieved by shortening the seat length which can be a challenge in that it could make your lower half go numb. to be fair it's economy you'll never be comfortable in this section unless your a child.

When we finally got off the plane they gave everyone $20 worth of meal vouchers and then the waiting began. Went to the gate in plenty of time as we had a lot of it to kill. There was no representative at the gate and when we checked the departure schedule discovered that our time had been delayed to 6.30. Suddenly the departure time changed to 7.30. How long does it take a 767 to get from Toronto to Denver even considering a new crew was needed? After changing gates we were told by an announcement that the plane was on the ground and would be at the gate by 6.30. Finally things were looking up. Started boarding about 7.00 and then we sat. The crew kept walking around the plane checking seats for some unknown reason while the passengers were getting restless and looking for answers as to why we were not leaving the gate. The pilot finally came on to tell us the plane needed rebalancing - I believe there were 6 people who made other arrangements and were not continuing on this flight. Finally left Denver after 8.00 and arrived in Vegas just before 9.30. Plane arrived in Terminal 1 and our bags were in Terminal 3. Again no information given by Air Canada staff so people basically had to figure out for themselves that you have to grab a shuttle bus for a 5 minute ride to Terminal 3 and then try and find the right carousel. Got to our hotel about 10.30 about 12 hours later than expected. Given the choice will not fly Air Canada in the future.",Economy,1,1,3,2,1,2,9,2014,0
23329,36017,thomson-airways,A Lloyd,United Kingdom,Flight to Sanford in premium seating even though Dreamliner was only one year old it had dirty seats and crumbs in crevices and overall looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly for a while. Shame as overall the Dreamliner comfort levels and room were great. Two man crew never smiled during service and didn't stop economy passengers using the premium toilets causing queues to form which shouldn't happen when paying additional £250 per person for the extra service.,Economy,8,4,2,3,5,3,10,2014,1
332,431,aeromexico,R Morgan,United States,I really think this airline is sadly overlooked in the US market. I took a chance on them a few years back when United dropped direct flights to places in Mexico I visit and found an airline with great service modern planes and competitive prices. The flight schedules are convenient and the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful when I have needed them. Only once have I had a issue due to weather - and they made sure to get me on another flight and while my bags did not make it on the plane they had them secured and waiting for me the next morning. In the past 3 years I have flown with them 10+ times and have no interest in looking elsewhere.,Business Class,10,5,5,4,5,4,12,2014,1
430,568,aeromexico,Jeff Berry,United States,"Today I was scheduled to fly from Mexico City to LAX but I was connecting from another city. Aeromexico screwed up the connection so I missed my leg to LAX. Instead of simply rebooking me on a later flight (of which there were three) they wanted to reticket me and charge me the then rate which was $650 more than I had originally paid. Seriously? You want me to pay $650 for your mistake. Worse when I said I'd fly Alaska instead they didn't care - but refused to refund me my original money for the MEX to LAX leg. This is the second such instance with this airline. Two years ago I was making the same trip and also was not able to complete the leg from MEX to LAX. They said there was ""weather problems"" in LA. (My family was at the airport in LA at the time and said it was clear as day and gorgeous weather). So they cancelled my flight to LAX and I was told I couldn't get on another flight until the next day. They made me pay for my hotel room at the Mexico City airport because it was a weather delay (which it wasn't) and was beyond their control. Worse I had purchased an upgrade to First Class earlier in the day (before the flight was cancelled) and when the First Class cabin was not available on the flight the next day they wouldn't refund my First Class upgrade cost even though they were going to put me in Coach. So when I got home I filed suit in Small Claims Court and I won the cost of the hotel and the First Class upgrade cost.",Economy,1,3,1,3,3,1,5,2014,0
1731,2469,air-canada-rouge,J Grodzki,United States,Flew from Vancouver to Honolulu on what I thought was Air Canada but was instead Rouge. It was the most uncomfortable flying experience I've had in years of travel on many airlines. Checking in at Vancouver International was handled by Air Canada ground staff in the usual courteous and efficient way but when boarding the aircraft I was surprised to see the flight attendants dresses in their ridiculous uniforms and hats and the drab decor of the aircraft. I squeezed into my seat and soon realized the next six hours were going to be an ordeal. Are you kidding me? I am very average slim 6 feet in height and I could not sit in my seat with my knees in front of me. The seats are hard barely recline and are immensely uncomfortable. The flight attendants were pleasant when they were around. No entertainment cramped seats beyond description made for a very long six hours. I am very disappointed to learn that Rouge is taking over all flights to Honolulu. This move by Air Canada is a terrible business decision. I will book with any other airline other than Rouge in the future. Never again Rouge!,Economy,1,1,4,3,1,1,12,2014,0

Come boarding time they had filled the cabin by upgrading economy passengers. I don't have a big problem with this but come the meal service time the FAs made it easy on themselves by just handing out economy meals to everyone. The breakfast was an alleged premium product but was unfortunately the worst airline food stale does not begin to describe the pain au chocolat. Not at all impressed with the fancy windows that don't black out properly on the Dreamliner.

2125,2876,air-canada-rouge,Barbara Bryan,Barbados,"Air Canada you have hit a new low it's called Rouge. Worst flight to Barbados in many years. They may fool some with their flight attendants wearing cute trilby hats as passengers boarded and with the cute pink headbands (my 5 year old grand daughter wears a similar one) while ""attending"" in flight but we were not fooled. They cannot try to mimic Westjet service until they actually do the work to train staff to actually believe that their job is to make their customers feel secure looked after and yes catered to! If they plan to staff their Rouge plane for an international flight it's a good idea to inform them of the entering countries landing document. When we asked for our landing cards we were told that they would be handed out at 2.10 (we arrived in B'dos at 2.25). We told them that B'dos requires a landing doc for each person not one per family as she rudely tried to tell me when I asked for 2 forms! Yikes! Immediately after the cards were handed out (one per family except for us) they told us to prepare for landing seats upright and tables closed - while everyone was still filling out their forms! After we landed the customs officers were scrambling to get people to fill out their forms. Make sure you have your ipads charged if you want entertainment. The seat monitors are gone. You can rent an ipad for 10 Cdn. But they have no means of charging your device. Also if you are taller than 5 feet and weigh more than 125 lbs you won't fit.

We found ourselves to be pleasantly surprised by the airline. All of our flights were on schedule the service from crew was very friendly and helpful. For example on one flight our daughter wasn't hungry at the time our first meal was served. Later in the flight we asked what food options were available to purchase and the flight attendant then returned with a spare full meal. I also liked the fact that the staff offered water numerous times throughout the flight and also collected rubbish at very regular intervals. More so than anything other flight I have been on and I really appreciated these small measures which add to the enjoyment of the flight. The seats were comfortable enough with sufficient leg room. Would like to see a little more variety in the entertainment offered (movie and television show wise). We found the check in process not to be completely straight forward. Both occasions on checking in the machines were not working correctly. We then had to be checked in by a staff member at the desk.

Before the flight took off I could only feel glad about the large amounts of leg room the old aircraft offered. I've not seen such a long leg room in any other Economy class flight. Pillows and blankets were fresh and I settled in. Since it was just a 3 hour night flight I preferred sleeping than watching movies. Hence the IFE's absence did not hurt me much. What impressed me was the extremely pleasant smiling and courteous service of the flight attendants. I had pre ordered a Hindu meal and what I got was excellent!

25098,38372,us-airways,Susan Mika,United States,"I was very much surprised and disappointed on my recent flight from Paris France to Philadelphia. I have never seen stewardesses act the way they did on this flight. I am an American yet most of the passengers were European. First off there was a language barrier. Some of the French passengers were sitting in the wrong seats. The stewardesses were telling the passenger to move. When they seemed confused these airline employees started to become very rude telling the passengers that because of them the flight was going to be late. I have never witnessed such disrespect on the employees part I decided to just remain in my seat and do as told not wanting to experience their wrath. No such luck My husband and I were dozing when they passed out ice cream. I couldn't find a spoon with the container. Not wanting to ""bother"" the stewardess I started to eat the ice cream using the lid as a spoon. The stewardess passed by and took the ice cream from my hands and took out the plastic spoon that was contained in the lid. I jokingly said ""sorry I couldn't find it"". Her abrupt response was ""you should have-they made an announcement where to find the spoon five minutes ago"" I could not believe my ears. I didn't even bother to tell her that I did not hear the announcement due to the fact that I was sleeping.

The new beds/seats are narrower and shorter they taper in at the end making them uncomfortable. This has allowed them to add more seats overall in the cabin but this is greatly at the expense of customer comfort. Again they have cut back again on the food service. You are no longer able to order a meal when you want you have to eat within 90 minutes of take off. Another deterioration in the service.

10345,14923,egyptair,Charles Kennedy,United Kingdom,"After a positive experience in economy recently I decided to fly them to China in business class due to a low fare plus the business class seat had looked very inviting when I walked past it on my previous flight. Indeed from LHR to CAI the seat was very nice although the service was very spotty just small things such as the cabin crew forgot to serve dessert to the last two rows of the cabin. Also if you serve a cup of tea with sachets of sugar perched on the saucer is it too much trouble to also include a teaspoon? I queued for ages for the forward lavatory before the milling flight attendants bothered to point out that there was also a lav aft. Basically an OK flight but with some weirdly amateurish omissions. Lounge in Cairo was a disgrace I spent most of the transit time crawling around on the floor of the ""business centre"" trying to get one / any of the computers to work (also wifi was broken). CAI to PEK was the long sector which I planned to make the most of the flat bed and sleep so imagine my disappointment to find that on this flight the seat was a much more old-fashioned ""Lazy Boy"" recliner and that after the doors closed the cabin crew upgraded all their friends which rather undermined the exclusivity of the cabin. Not worth paying for if crew use the business class cabin as a perk for their friends nor if the airline are deploying flat beds on short flights (LHR) and unsatisfying old seats on long flights (PEK).

IFE available but was unwatchable due to video and audio quality. Digi-players provided on some flights/aircraft and I would have appreciated these being available for this 6 hour flight given Air Pacific seem to be aware of the poor quality of the IFE. Priority bags delivered first and through customs and on the way home in 20 minutes of arriving.

Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar.

18214,27159,philippine-airlines,C Chapman,United States,MNL-KIX-MNL. I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first trip on them and I would fly them again. For starters my ticket was very inexpensive so that is always a plus. It was actually less expensive on Philippine Air than some of the other local budget carries and I got to check a bag for free. Departed Manila on time and arrived in Osaka about 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Meal was Japanese Curry Beef which was tasty and the mango jelly that came with it was delicious. The one disappointing thing is only one drink service but they did give me the entire can of soda so can't complain about that. During my stay in Osaka I got the news of typhoon heading towards the Philippines so I decided to change the ticket last minute to get back earlier and the change fee was only 100 USD which in this day and age is amazing. There was also no increase in fare. The crew on the flight home did a really commendable job as the circumstances they were dealing with could have been trying. I have never been on a flight where the seat belt sign was on almost the entire time it was 4 hours of bumps turbulence and grabbing the seat handles but the crew despite being interrupted 3 times and having to return to their seats were able to complete their meal service clean up and duty free. I had the pork dish which wasn't bad and the fruit platter was refreshing and quite good. I am a big fan of their inflight entertainment concept - they don't have the usual movie screens (at least not on the A330) but instead you can stream from their library right into your tablet laptop or MAC however their library left a lot to be desired. I really think their system is the new way to go but they need to improve the selection of films. They also offer in flight WiFi but I did not use. I'm not sure what their selection is like on their long haul flights but they could upgrade to some more modern movies on the short international routes. They're not the best airline in Asia I've flown but they're not that far behind either. The food was good service good and planes clean.

Not all problems are Garuda's taxes are government but passengers must be fully informed. Transit passengers should be assisted not abandoned. If a Garuda is serious about creating a better reputation it must address information services and passenger assistance.,Business Class,5,5,4,3,3,3,3,2014,0
8256,11463,british-airways,R Vincent,United Kingdom,Flew to Vegas on 8th May and dismayed at the standard. Filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. Only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. Sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative; we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did (around row 31) as it normally happened. The worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.,Economy,2,3,1,1,4,1,5,2014,0

The A34O used to Auckland has the new seat layout which is the same seat configuration as the 777-300 and is quite comfortable. Bigger screens and better overall than the older 340 used on the route before. Took off on time and arrived a little early. Food and service always very good.

10799,15521,emirates,P Hill,Australia,I have flown with Emirates on and off for the last 10 years and have enjoyed great service over the years and seen a lot of improvements. My most recent flight was LGW to DXB on the A380. This plane is great and the bar / lounge is a must not just a gimmick as seen on other airlines. My only negative is that the meal service has been steadily declining over the years. First the 'As You like It' menu disappears and now it seems that to obtain a glass of wine with your meal you have to wait until you have nearly finished for the wine to appear. Its the little touches that make flying Emirates a pleasure but they need to be maintained otherwise Qatar and Etihad with their dine on demand will gain more business.,Business Class,8,5,4,3,5,4,7,2014,1

7641,10747,british-airways,J Miller,United States,Round-trip IAD-LHR in early October and it was one of the best trips I've taken. The seat may be the same size as on US carriers but it felt a lot larger. I was stunned to be served a free cocktail and a free bottle of wine with dinner which was a totally edible chicken casserole in one direction and a surprisingly good chicken curry in the other direction. I was also pleased to get a blanket and headphones (though I had my own). US carriers don't give squat to economy passengers and I was delighted. Service was the quickest most efficient I've ever seen on an airplane. Loved the entertainment system. Even the boarding process was seriously well organized with separate lines and doors for each section of the plane. This was about as painless as it could possibly have been. I will never fly an American carrier to Europe again. I also got a good deal at a little over $700 as fall is a down season.,Economy,10,5,5,4,5,5,10,2014,1

I booked this flight BCN-ATH 3 months ago and at check in no two seats next to each other were available hence my wife in row 18 and myself in row 26. This was the first time an airline separates passengers. I know I could have bought seats but I hate these airline tricks. On the positive side landing was excellent.

In-flight entertainment was also good with a variety of options available on the system. However I rather dislike how they don't allow the option of choosing a seat when making the flight booking as I ended up in the exit row right in front of the lavatory. The flight itself however was okay with service being acceptable although not as attentive as one might expect (they seemed to begin offering landing cards and then walked away several times etc.).,Economy,6,4,3,4,4,4,7,2014,0

We were a party of five all booked in economy we decided before hand to book our seats online as the extra cost allowed us to be guaranteed seats together. We boarded on time but were delayed ""on stand"" for around thirty minutes no explanation of this slight delay was given however our flight still arrived early at Orlando but more on this later. The aircraft itself was quite old and the cabin was tired and in need of renovation. We were sitting in row 12 and seat 12G would not stay in the upright position we asked a member of the cabin crew if they could help in any way and two of our party were upgraded to premium economy straight away. The seat pitch in economy was fine with plenty of leg room but they were not very wide with no room at all for movement. The entertainment selection was good but the system is dated and not all screens and audio outlets worked correctly with some not working at all. The flight crew were professional polite and attentive. They did not try to sell us things other than the normal duty free stuff. The food was prepared well and was a little better than average but not to the taste of everyone in the party so the pre packed sandwiches came in handy. Orlando airport were not prepared for our arrival and were late connection the air ridge to the aircraft and they did not unlock the door at the exit point prior to letting passengers off the aircraft. We would use this airline again but the aircraft would need to be refurbished.",Economy,7,2,4,4,2,3,7,2014,0

For the overall value, we were actually pretty happy. I'm 6'3 and yes, the seats have a medieval aesthetic which meant the person in front literally had no chance of reclining their seat and I spent the trip with one leg in the aisle when possible. For four hours, though, I can suck it up and enjoy decent service from the 3 flight attendants. Paying for food, booze and iPads is relatively good value as well.

2587,3417,air-europa,W Teoh,United Kingdom,I can't say I was impressed especially on the long haul sector. I recently did a London - Madrid - Havana de Cuba. The flight from London to Madrid was pleasant and aircraft was very new. For a regional flight it was very well equipped and decent selections for food purchase. Transit in Madrid was easy enough despite Madrid not being the most organized airport. The long haul flight to Havana was a different story. The staff do not seem to be well co-ordinated for boarding at all which means it was really slow as people were not directed properly. The aircraft was quite dated and my fear was confirmed that there was no individual TV. That was fine but my luck meant that my headset point didn't work (both times going out and return flight). Flight was full so not a lot of options there but force myself to try sleeping. Meals were average but the massive gap between meals were crazy! If they missed you because you were sleeping they won't come back to you even if they are still serving others further down the aisles. Overall can't say I recommend it.,Economy,3,2,2,2,1,4,12,2013,0

This was my first experience with Rouge and I will do everything I can to make sure it's my last. The comments noted by so many; cramped seating non existent inflight entertainment etc don't need to be repeated again.

The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail.

16351,24450,malaysia-airlines,J Capstick,Australia,Only positive things I can say is the seat on the Airbus 380 was one of the most comfortable I have used and the satay was lovely. From Heathrow seat very comfy and the satay was very nice but make sure you have 2 or 3 serves as the rest of the food was inedible certainly not up to the standard of other (cheaper) business class meals I have eaten. Chef on call as advertised by them was not available and to order the meals you had to call would have been ok but I had 2 numbers and each number was a message that told me to call the other number. IFE and service moderate have had much better. Late into KL so was herded straight onto next flight to Sydney (Airbus 330-300) seats were very uncomfortable so slanted I kept falling down them no way to get comfortable at all I had an angled seat on a much cheaper airline and it was much more comfortable that this one it was just slanted so legs ached no matter what position it was put in.

16873,25134,lufthansa,Jonathan Turner,Germany,I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.,Business Class,10,3,5,3,3,3,6,2014,1

Our transit in Amman exceeded 6 hours and we were pleasantly surprised to be shuttled to the Golden Tulip Queen Alia Hotel. Amman to Bangkok was on a larger A330 again with individual IFE's 2 full hot meals and a snack and attentive service.

18903,28213,qantas-airways,W Williams,Australia,Flew JFK-LAX-SYD on the return leg - upgraded to Business on the way back. With the way Qantas have changed their redeeming of FF points it seemed like a prudent investment of 60000 points to upgrade (from Premium Economy). Going through the Express passport control at JFK is so much easier & the BA lounge is quite decent. The lounge at LAX is also good - albeit a little crowded when I was there. Both legs of the flight were really well done (very good crew) and good food - the omelette with fetta and smoked salmon at breakfast before landing in Sydney was especially good. The bed worked well - it is the first time I have slept solidly on a plane (and I have flown in Business many times). It was quite amusing seeing the mature FA wrestle the bed cover on with such vigour! I reckon she could take down any recalcitrant passengers easily!

The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface.

10082,14387,delta-air-lines,Kaval Lodhie,United States,"I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome"" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice.

Return flight, suddenly my carryon, which had flow with me all over Canada for 3.5 weeks (I was covering the Women's World Cup) is too large or too heavy, though it is max carry on size on other airlines I've flown. Wouldn't let us board. After 30 minutes and showing them the photographic gear they wanted me to put below (they would not guarantee it's safety,) they finally accepted my idea to put my camera bag in the crew area. Onboard, they ran out of food. Flight attendants left our consumed flood on our trays for 1.5 hours. When I rang call button to ask them to pick up the tray, I was chastised and told to set it on the floor. The attendant who came to me couldn't take it away, she told to me to set it on the floor in the exit row. ",Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,2015,0
2808,3733,air-france,J Parris,United Kingdom,My family including my 3 year old daughter had a flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to Manchester which we had booked 8 months previous. We were unable to carry out an online check in before taking flight due to poor wifi signal at our holiday destination so arrived at check in 3 hours before our flight was due to leave to give us plenty of time. When we checked in we were told the flight was already full and we were placed on stand by. After waiting at gate for everyone else to board we were informed that only two seats were available and we could split up if we wanted or stay as a group of 3 on the next flight to Manchester. We decided to stay as a family - we went to the customer service desk only to be told that the next flight was completely full. After spending an hour at the desk with a very bored and upset young child we were informed that the only flight we could take that day was to Birmingham over 90 miles away from Manchester where our car was parked. After 11 hours in the airport we departed - on arrival to Birmingham we then had to organise transportation at considerable cost to ourselves to Manchester to collect our car. Safe to say I will never fly with Air France again and I will never recommend them to anyone else as there customer service was appalling.,Economy,1,2,1,1,1,1,9,2014,0

The flight from Bellingham to Honolulu had the best airline food I have had. The crew were friendly on all legs. One thing that did annoy was that even though an announcement was made at the start of each flight that the front toilet was for first class only during the flight Economy passengers would use it and not be stopped.

Our first ANA experience and we had high expectations. Check in was very good but went downhill from there. Was directed to the United lounge which is cavernous but poor selection of food for breakfast. On board the 767 the seats had limited recline which made sleeping difficult. Biggest disappointment was the food. I had high hopes for the Japanese selection but what I was offered for lunch was bland and poorly presented. My wife wanted the international menu (no choice) but was advised it had run out even though we were seated in the second row. No cheese or fruit was available as a substitute. The over the top apology from the chief cabin supervisor was embarrassing. No amenities kit.

No one seemed to know where I should go and people (CityJet staff) told me 2 different things. No one informs you that you can't check in until 2 hours before (until you've waited in different lies because misdirected) and there is no CityJet counter in Florence. Not labelled anywhere.

My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class.

Flew out on British Airways and enjoyed the excellent service. On return I lost my British Airways flight. Bought a TAP Portugal return flight from Lisbon. I was initially happy to use TAP ""main Portuguese carrier"" instead of low-cost carriers like Ryanair or Easyjet. TAP Portugal is a low-cost carrier with expensive tickets and lousy service. Flight was delayed 1 hr 20 mins no excuses or proper information given to passengers. Disorganised boarding with unprofessional ladies shouting no apologies from captain or crew there was no inflight entertainment newspaper magazines or wi-fi on the flight to London. Only drinks served for the entire flight. Leg room was very poor. So the return journey had all the hallmarks of a ""no frills"" budget airline. However the ticket was purchased at a premium (almost££380 for the return journey in Economy class) when Ryanair and Easyjet charge £65. Unless things change with TAP Portugal they will go down it is only a matter of time before customers go to low-cost carriers they receive the same service TAP offered me but 5 times cheaper.

When we were checking in it was very hard to get some help because for some reason the kiosk let myself check my bag but not my friend. It took a good 10 minutes to get any help and we just kept getting walked past. Got to the gate and the plane ended up being delayed for 50 minutes now. When we got to Phoenix we had 5 minutes to get to our next flight. Turns out they changed the gate last minute and instead of only having to go from gate A10 to A12 we had to go from about A20 to B2 in 5 minutes. My friend and I sprinted from our gate to get to the next one and we arrived with one minute before they close the doors (since they close them 10 minutes before departure) The door was closed and there wasn't a sole around. I went to the next gate and I explained our flight was delayed twice and there was a last minute gate change. Very rudely she told me she was aware and then went back to talking to her friend.

Inflight service however was generally rather good. I was told I had to phone China to get a seat assignment. What kind of airline has no phone number or no working website to take care of such basic matters? I did call China and they assigned a non-existent seat number! The seat I did get eventually on the flight from NRT to CAN did not work properly and I couldn't even use the tray table to eat my dinner. Due to an unannounced change in aircraft the plane arrived at CAN more than 90 minutes late and we missed our onward connection to Sydney. This can happen with any airline. The test of good service is what happens next. What happened next was a massive problem on the ground. The CZ staff seemed to be completely unprepared for and totally unequipped to deal with the problem of a planeload of people unable to travel onward. And yet if you read other reviews this is clearly something that happens frequently and something the staff should have a great deal of experience with. None of the promised services for business class passengers were provided - in either direction - during the Guangzhou stop-over. The ground staff seemed amazed and offended that I would expect them to provide the services promised in their own printed brochures.

Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe!

When airborne inflight entertainment was poor due to technical issues furthermore only some IFE were working. No maps nor flight info or flight data. Food was poor only served a proper meal once.

479,635,aerolineas-argentinas,U Grant,Australia,I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.,Economy,7,4,4,3,0,5,9,2012,1

Terminal was busy and we were whisked to the new B737-800 by bus. Terminal was congested and we were on the runway for an hr before take off. Seats were comfortable and we slept. Cabin crew served one round of drinks to the 80% full flight. Children were given JAL stickers. Drop down screens showed flight map. Headphones were provided for music entertainment. Return flight on same aircraft. Managed to get upgrade to J class. Check in staff was new and it took her 40 mins to check in our 4 bags + 2 strollers. To our surprise she checked in our bags all the way to Singapore even thought our flight to SIN was not under One World (Delta Airlines).

25900,39358,vietnam-airlines,D Patrick,Australia,MEL-SGN-CDG and return. We decided to try Vietnam Airlines as they offered Australia to Europe flights at a significantly lower price to other airlines I've used in the past. We got what we paid for and nothing more. Note that Australia and Europe flights aren't timed to connect with each other which means a 16 hour layover in each direction. This worked out well as we were able to exit the airport stay at a nearby hotel and freshen up before the connecting flight while our bags remained in transit. The only problem with this is you need to purchase apply for a visa before leaving MEL which can up to 140 AUD on top of the fare. The MEL-SGN flights on the A330 were fine however the 777-200 on the SGN-CDG leg is looking very tired. The seat back IFE is limited and works in channels rather than on demand. Most of the cabin crew could not speak much English. The food out of MEL and CDG was okay but the food out of SGN was terrible.

Fed up seeing the long faces of the staff with the occasional false smile not all their fault because the company is always trying to squeeze every cent of profit. Have travelled with Air Canada on same route they are even worse. Look forward to the day when another company enters the route.

20770,31191,singapore-airlines,C Gilbert,New Zealand,6 flights in July. Auckland - Singapore SGN-BKK Da Nang - SGN. SGN - Cebu. Cebu - SGN and SGN-AKL. All were full. At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews’attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.,Economy,7,3,4,3,3,4,8,2014,0

The leg room is terrible and the entertainment system is worst than awful offering old movies at a high cost (10$ to rent the iPad and 5$ to access the movies).

Apparently they each cost $129 more and I would need to pay $387 to have seats that reclined. The seats were empty but still given my situation I wasn't allowed to sit there with my boys who were very upset. What I cannot accept is the fact that a man in my row sneaked to the same row across the aisle and sat there the whole flight for no additional fee.

Nice friendly and subtle staff unlimited tea and coffee and if you've been good and somehow found yourself in SAS plus (no idea what I did to deserve this but it was cheaper than economy) you can have as many treats from the buy-on-board menu as you like. The lounges in ARN and OSL were both nice well lit and calm but with very traditional Scandinavian food (which I love but perhaps not everyone does.) Generally on time but OSL-LHR was 20 minutes late due to the ""absence of the crew"" (did they get lost?!) They seem to be moving over to letting you download newspapers and magazines through their app rather than giving so many out - hard to read on a phone and doesn't work on the Kindle so it wasn't ideal for me as I didn't have a tablet. SAS is an airline I want to love.

CA is not my go-to carrier because they are priced higher on average and they don't have much flight time options for this route comparing to China Southern. Unless someone pays for your flights this under 3 hour-ish flight usually can just get away with economy seats because it is too short to enjoy anything premium. I got a half-priced business class deal this time so I tried it. Overall: I think it really did not mean much unless you are saving up miles with them. The word ""lukewarm"" can summarize my entire experience from the lounge service (staff) to the in-flight lunch (room-temp un-appealing Asian dish) that was served 60 minutes before landing - imagine how they ushered me to finish the meal within 15 minutes. No friendly name calls like United (they don't even greet you by name) and they skipped me for drinks and hand towels because I took a nap. I suppose I need to be alert the entire time to be adequate enough for serving?

United has the worst food and in-flight entertainment in the industry. The flight attendants want to serve you food immediately after the flight begins so they can chatter in the forward and rear galleys of the airplane. Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers. United Airlines overall is of the worst carriers for inflight services in the airline industry. I was in Business/First and they wanted me to pay for both the internet and DirectTV why don't you just consider me a customer that hates your airlines and that will avoid you at all costs.,Business Class,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2015,0
6667,9295,austrian-airlines,Emiliano Morchi,Italy,"MXP-VIE-SOF and VAR-VIE-MXP. All those flights apart the VIE-SOF were done by using Fokker aircraft: although not new at all they proved comfortable. In the other leg we flew with a new A320 with slim seats: acceptable legroom quite comfortable. The food that we were provided was acceptable given the length of the flights. Crew polite and efficient but a bit cold (and with terrible uniforms). The only inconvenience was in Vienna airport: in order to catch the connection we had to run because we lost time at an unnecessary additional security control as we proceeded from another EU member State although out of Schengen area. Then the plane was kept 45 mins at the finger in order to wait some more connecting passenger. I think that if is planned to wait long for people it should be better to write ""final call"" on the screens. In general however I've been satisfied.",Economy,8,4,4,4,0,3,4,2013,1
20007,29754,sata-air-azores,Mike Hughes,Canada,Flew Toronto - Lisbon return Feb 2015. Flights were on time. Cabin crew courteous. A310 aircraft is old but kept cabin kept in a clean condition. Seats were hard and could not get comfortable. Restricted to one choice at meal time. On the way out to Lisbon meat was provided and return only chicken. Wine served with the meal was low quality. Very acidic. One passenger complained and the attendant returned with a bottle from business class. Maybe they should serve the same wine to all passengers. Arrange with the airline in advance if you have diet issues. Entertainment was basic. A few screens centre overhead aisle. No duty free. After the meal if a drink was required self service at the back galley.,Business Class,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,2015,0
16269,24345,lufthansa,R Nazmul,Sweden,ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad. Overall I'm very satisfied with Lufthansa's service very nice flight attendants they also had very helpful ground crew at DEL.

Outbound to Ponta Delgada from Boston movie starts playing audio starts 20 minutes later. Inbound from Porto to Boston large wall screen in our section wasn't working. We could not watch the movie. Asked crew twine about it never came back with an answer. Not surprised because the same thing happened with no audio on a trip 2 years earlier. The crew should spent less time doing a head count before departure and try harder to act upon customer's issues on board. I've complained via email to SATA about these problems before.

17655,26187,norwegian,S Beer,United Kingdom,Travelling from JFK to LGW on 2 Apr 15 had a terrible trip. First they changed the aircraft but that was ok as we found the old Emirates plane quite comfortable in fact. Then as we arrived at 16.00 from Raleigh we found the flight was changed from 22.50 to 05.00 next day. There was not one person in the airport we could speak to and as we had no local mobile service and Wifi was not free we struggled to contact the contact centre. Had we been able to get free phone calls as EU rules advise we would have cancelled and taken an evening flight with another airline. But we had to wait till 19.30 to speak to a rep- too late for a discussion about a refund. Other EU rules disregarded by Norwegian - no hotel and transport to hotel offered though this would have been reasonable given the huge delay. We got food vouchers for 18 dollars per person which we had to spend by 23.00 as all catering closed then. Then we slept or tried to sleep in a neon lit noise filled lounge in upright seats as not other option except the floor. There were families with children toddlers old people (me included there) all stranded and ignored. The only reason I give a satisfaction score above zero is because the outward flight was reasonable though still late off the tarmac. Wish I had heeded other reviews. We like a bargain and were happy with the price but this company is not offering any kind of value for money so we will not use them again.,Economy,3,3,3,0,3,2,4,2015,0

Flights between Doha and Warsaw and Vienna and Doha were good completely opposite to the longer haul. Midnight flight out of MEL thought I would be able to sleep for the first part - wrong. Hot meal served about 1.5 hrs into flight sometime before cabin lights turned off. Cabin crew don't insist on seats upright at meal times so bit squashed if person in front has seat fully reclined and meals not as good as shorter flights. No foot rests so legs soon started aching 1am flight out of DOH on return sleeping when meal came so didn't get any drinks/meal until 2 hrs before landing in MEL.

No aerobridge at MAA and the business class passengers get crushed with the economic class passengers on the bus ride from the aircraft to the terminal. No Priority baggage delivery.

Seats in between window and aisle were empty for more Comfort. As soon as we were on our flight level the morning meal was served.

Monarch's newer seats have more legroom than the old ones but are far less comfortable than the old seats as the new ones don't recline and they're quite solid.

I provided the airline with my booking number when I contacted them so they saw my booking details.

Seats were bearable the old lie flat type but after 20minutes we were told that the entire entertainment system didn't work and were offered an insulting EUR 20 voucher. For a flight of 12 hours this was totally unacceptable and the second time the system hasn't worked on the same plane (May 2012). Finnair please address this.

The return journey left on time again with pleasant cabin crew and quite a decent breakfast was served. We landed early.

19801,29332,qatar-airways,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.,Economy,7,4,5,4,4,5,11,2013,1

Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats.

Service on GRU- LIM and LIM-SCL was horrible perhaps due to red-eye flight. Cabin crew the worst I have seen and when I asked them for a cup of water they told me it was self-service. LIM-CUS return was better. Seats are ok. Food just cold sandwiches or snack box. TAM deserves a better rating than LAN in service.

The negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable - on both flights the IFE had to be re-set at least once.

On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that BA appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings.

19555,29003,qatar-airways,Derek Gilboe,Saudi Arabia,Qatar Airways provides commendable in-flight services particularly in their business/first cabins. The flight crews are always focused on service doing their utmost to ensure passenger comfort. Highlights of the airline are the newer aircraft and a strong focus on the aircraft interiors that maximize passenger comfort particularly the large overhead bins on their Boeing aircraft and newer Airbus fleet additions. Food on the flights in business is excellent with choices for breakfast indulgence (snack) and main meals with a broad selection of wines. Equally nice are the sleepwear provided on longer flights with the extra padding in the sleep covers for the business/first seats. While the in-flight experience is excellent the airline is facing challenges with the terminal and transit experience. Outside of Doha lounges were very limited although joining OneWorld has opened up many new lounges suitable for premium customers; unfortunately they face ground staff issues at several airports that frustrate during the boarding and deplaning process. The new airport in Doha their primary hub is open but facing considerable growing pains and still relies on buses for many airport transits. Coupled with insufficient lounge space particularly for their premium customers significantly compromises the overall trip experience and turns their new flagship airport in Doha to a frustrating experience that undermines the excellent in-flight service and value for the money in the competitive market of air travel.,Business Class,2,5,5,4,4,2,6,2014,1

Their version of business class is that they only fill the aisle and window seats leaving the centre seat open - really? How does that make up for horrendously uncomfortable narrow seats and no legroom? Entertainment was a joke - movies on I-pads were very old (Gigi) and certainly not very thought provoking. I gave up and read for the duration of the trip. FA's uniforms are terrible. Come on Air Canada what are you trying to do here.

26286,39757,virgin-australia,L Carter,Australia,VA23 MEL-LAX Premium (11 H) connecting from OOL. Luggage checked entire way through had to pick up express boarding pass in MEL (not sure if comes with premium or not I'm a Platinum FF). Cabin was practically full with only a couple of seats spare. Plenty of legroom although the 2 heights that the footrest sits at doesn't make it overly comfortable the seat width difference is definitely noticeable vs domestic economy. Amenities bag comes with socks eye mask toothbrush/paste hand cream tissues and a pen (which is more than I can say for SQ business). Headphones provided are noise blocking - and they definitely work. Every meal had tomato and cheese in it which was not only a little disappointing but seriously lacking in originality the chicken was nice and tender though once I scraped the tomato off! Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice. The best bit would have to be the service. From the FA's to the pilots keeping us up to date on delays could not have asked for better - the staff are definitely what make flying Virgin Australia a happy experience! I used points to upgrade not sure if I'd pay for Premium outright but using points or paying for an upgrade last minute on a return leg is worth it.,Premium Economy,7,3,5,2,3,3,5,2014,1

Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.,Economy,7,4,4,3,2,4,3,2015,1

12351,17444,finnair,W de Beest,United Kingdom,Could hardly disagree more with the other 27 Aug reviewer. I flew the same day - possibly on the same plane - and found it intolerable. I'm 197cm but can get adequately comfortable in most short-haul economy but not this the hard plastic strip concealing the seat hinges cut into my shins while the rigid seat back was pressed hard against my knees. Bad enough as a static sensation until the oversized baboon in front can't sit still and slams his seat into me every other minute. I seldom refuse food while travelling but the 'tandoori turkey' (the clue is in the title) sandwich was dry and inedible. With no wine on offer to improve it and no space to unfold the table for a cup of coffee a solitary glass of water had to do for sustenance on a three-hour flight. The crew were pleasant enough. I'll be flying this route again but next time I'll make sure my BA ticket gets me on a BA plane.,Economy,2,1,3,2,0,2,9,2013,0
25209,38523,united-airlines,R Dow,United Kingdom,"I flew with United for the first time back in June/July flying non-stop on the new service between Edinburgh and Chicago and on to Wausau. I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the ""Premium Access"" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus. I had a scheduled stop over of six hours but United decided to double it to 12 as the plane taking me to Wausau was delayed due to weather which I will say not entirely United's fault but some food and drink tokens would not of gone un-noticed.

You get your choice of seat when you book choice of meal before economy class and many small perks. When we went to Mexico the cost was $80 again worth it.

2810,3735,air-france,M Shelton,United States,I flew Air France with six different legs of a European trip in August. Each time we flew into CDG. Fabulous employees. But not one departure left on time. Departures varied from 20 minutes delayed to over an hour. Missed one connection due to this and twice my daughter's wheelchair was lost and finally located again but we were always last leaving plane. Our luggage was lost for one and a half days on our first leg of trip (CDG to Manchester UK) because the flight left Boston so late we were connected to a smaller regional aircraft due to arriving late in CDG thus missing the scheduled Air France flight. In Boston we were told to get our boarding passes for the flight to UK in Paris. In Paris they asked for our boarding passes and it took over an hour to resolve that we were told to get them in Paris and that was the first leg of our disappointing trip. Again wonderful staff but it seems one airport location does not communicate well to another location which then uses up a lot of time at help desks at each airport trying to resolve the issues. The only time our delay was acknowledged was on our last leg of trip back to Boston - this left 20 minutes late which wasn't too bad but we sat on tarmac in Boston without much information for over an hour. The next day we got an e-mail from Air France apologizing for that. But the other five legs of the trip also were with problems. I would not fly Air France again unless I really had no other option unfortunately.,Economy,4,3,5,4,4,3,9,2014,0

The seat is good but everything else was mediocre at best. Lounge at Changi airport dreadful no proper business class queue at gate. No priority passport lines either at Changi or Hong-Kong airports. Walking distance from Lounge to departure gate at HKG is insane. In-flight service on both flights was all done in a hurry by noticeably overworked crew. Food was very mediocre. have had much better meals on many coach flights. Seat folds out to flat bed but on the A330 service HKG-CNS the small cubby hole where Your feet go the feet feel claustrophobic and it was boiling hot in there.

Booked through WebJet some sort of cock up led to us being charged $260 to take a couple of bags onboard. Upon trying to pre-pay luggage for the return trip advised this was completely impossible by VA. However went to the airport on the return leg expecting another huge bill and baggage checked in without a murmur! Go figure. On the plus side no delays and got us there and back just fine.

The counter employees were quick to re-assign seats and tried their best to accommodate every ones request.

During the flight I pointed out to the flight attendant in the business class that there was no more toilet paper and she thanked me and put a new roll you would think she could check the other bathroom no. Some time later I was in that one no toilet paper either both rolls empty. This is not acceptable. Not once did any of the cabin staff make any effort to communicate during the flight with the passengers. They just did what needed to be done and finished (except check the lavatories).

Usually good service but I have found it difficult to understand why they still have some old aircraft's flying routes - it does not represent Singapore well when it has one of the best economies in the world. The frequent flyer programme seems to have been altered also over recent years to make it so much harder to get gold status unless you pay lots more for tickets on economy. Recently I have noticed that they are handing out in-flight earpieces that I have had a bad experience with and dislike. Two flights recently when I used these I could not hear the movie clearly at all despite trying a new set. From then on I ask for the old headpiece sound sets which work well.

I tested the speed at 2 Mb/sec download and 0.25 Mb/sec upload. I rented an entertainment player for $8 and had time to watch a movie along with a few other clips. The devices are a little slow and touchy but are still functional. Soon Alaska Airlines will offer entertainment on your own iPads laptops etc. I purchased the chicken dinner for $6 which consisted of boneless chicken breast mashed potatoes and green beans and actually tasted very good.

The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines. I can honestly say that I would rather pay a little more to be able to get a drink of water if I need one and to have someone friendly and happy to see me come on board.,Economy,1,1,1,1,0,2,9,2014,0

The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland.

The onboard lounge was really nice the food was good and I met a few passengers on the flight with me which was a good experience. Turbulence hit which was really strong and stayed for some time so I was sort of stuck in the lounge for some time but I was busy chatting with the crew and passengers. Flight arrived on time.

In addition to main meals mangoes/blueberry Ice cream was served before landing in Denpasar/Bali My only criticism is the connecting flight arrangement in Bali. I had to take my luggage out before proceeding to the domestic lounge. Although I had staff assisting me the whole process was indeed unnecessary.

15954,23727,lan-airlines,S Reid,New Zealand,Just flown LAN on a return trip via Santiago to Buenos Aires. No complaints about this airline. Check in was smooth at all points and the staff pleasant and accommodating. Planes left on time and the announcements were clearly made when in English. My only problem was they did not issue an arrival card on the return sector even if napping it could have been placed in the seat pocket as others have done. Would also like to have been offered more fluid while airborne.,Economy,8,5,4,4,2,4,12,2012,1

They did everything right. My seat was 1D since no one was in the exit row seats they let me move back and allowed my friend in coach to move next to me he is 6 ft 3 so that was great for him. The attendants were on their game the whole trip and got me coffee after their normal serving time without a hitch. Only problem was my seat sound connection crackled so I used the seat connection next to me. No problem as long as no one is directly next to you.,Business Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,10,2014,1

Even though it has not refurbished yet your business class seat offers you such large space so that you do NOT need to jump your neighbour in case you need to reach the aisle. Seat is lie-flat and very comfortable. Cabin crew are very pleasant and wine selection is top notch. Food could be better but I cannot complain as wines and spirits outweighs the balance. Both AVOD and cabin cleanliness are things Iberia should improve. I would recommend it.,Business Class,9,5,5,4,3,5,3,2014,1

This is a very poor (economy class) passenger seat design of Boeing the thin seat cushions are not finished with durable comfort foam.

Business lounge was nicely refurbished and expanded since the last time I visited in April. I was greeted personally once on board by one of the cabin crew which I thought was a nice touch. Food was decent for coach and drink runs were abundant. The cons to the flight was that the 772 used to fly this route is seriously starting to show its age. AVOD carried a wide enough selection of films but was not the most state of the art touch screen ones you find on newer planes. Baggage was already on the carousel by the time I cleared immigration but it didn't mean much as I was met by a colossal line to clear customs due to the poor facilities at LA airport.

The flight attendant was unwilling to help and replied that she also had a hand injury. When I asked her again she offered to check my luggage. I declined her offered and explain that my luggage is not heavy but due to a hand injury I have limited range of hand motion and showed her the hand with the hand brace on. She replied again that she also had a hand injury and just stood there. It wasn't until I asked her for another flight attendant to help me that she suggested that we put the luggage up together.

The planes were old but the seats leg room service and food were top class. In-flight entertainment was zero as the PTVs were not working on both legs both ways. Our luggage could have been handled better. Other than these my wife and I had no room for complaint. The KU-JFK flight was delayed by about 5-6 hours. The return flights were bang on time.

Brand new seats but seats very uncomfortable and small seat pitch. Very small tray table not even large enough to hold a laptop and a beverage at the same time. These seats are perhaps the worse seats I have encountered. Slight delay due to computer errors pilots had to reboot the computers.

13032,18602,frontier-airlines,A Gipson,United States,"I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. ""If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements."" After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent. I feel that it is ridiculous that I have to go on Frontier's website and show it to Frontier agents in order for anything to happen.",Economy,1,2,1,2,0,1,8,2012,0

She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!,Business Class,9,5,5,4,0,5,5,2014,1

The service was good the food better on the outbound not wonderful but good. However the design of the seating whilst very comfortable made exiting when the flat screens employed virtually impossible. Finding the control and call buttons is also a challenge.

20094,29953,sas-scandinavian-airlines,T Kemp,Denmark,"CPH-SFO in SAS Plus. SAS Plus is not quite business but far better than Premium Economy on most airlines. For example I've flown Y+ on KLM which basically means a little more legroom but otherwise the same as Y. With SAS Plus however you get FastTrack security check Lounge Access (at least their CPH lounge is pretty good with showers decent food and alcohol selection and fairly quiet at least when I flew quick internet access). The flight itself is in a bit wider seats than Y (wide enough to not be a problem I sat next to a ""heavier"" gentleman and we had no issues with the shared armrest) and with more than enough legroom. The food and drink service is also much better than in normal Y class. Unlimited alcoholic drinks and snacks throughout the flight and fairly good inflight meals (both dinner and breakfast - I really enjoyed the breakfast) with steal cutlery ceramics and glass instead of plastic plastic and plastic. Together with the 200% FF miles earning this was all a good value compared to regular economy. Especially if you upgrade through OptionTown. The only negatives is the tiny and dimly lit IFE system - I would have been better off watching a movie on my phone or tablet. However movie selection was good and recent (with at least a handful of the current year's blockbusters already available).

Nowadays there is not much differences between the main airlines and LAN offered what is expected in Economy Class: Two full meals (somewhat more basic than on main European carriers but portions a little larger) good IFE system and professional service from the staff - less personal but on European carriers but nothing to complain about. Main complain was the hard narrow seats on Boeing 777-300ER as in other carriers using the 3x4x4 option seats are much less comfortable than formerly and make long-distant flights something of a challenge but TAM is not alone here.,Economy,7,2,4,4,4,4,1,2015,1

16479,24585,malaysia-airlines,McWatt John,United Kingdom,Travelled recently to New Zealand with my wife to visit our son. The flights out and back were with Malaysia Airlines. The flights out from LHR to KL and from KL to Auckland were not exactly the best we have experienced. The service on board during both flights was average and did not reflect the friendliness with which Malaysia is renowned. The staff seemed intent on serving drinks and food as fast as they could and ignored reasonable requests for additional items such as water not only from us but other passengers as well. The food served up was pretty poor and certainly did not reflect the style or quality expected of Richard Corrigan the airlines named chef. To add insult to injury when we arrived in Auckland our luggage apparently was still in LHR we eventually received them 5 days later. Our return flights this time from Auckland to KL and KL to Amsterdam were no better and we rated the food on offer as being worse than the outbound flights. Indeed neither of us could eat anything on the KL to Amsterdam flight as it was almost inedible. The service was marginally better than the outgoing flights however still fell short of what we had expected. When we queried the delayed luggage at Auckland prior to the return flights we were simply passed off with various excuses. Indeed the contact numbers we were given somewhat reluctantly were useless as they only connected to ticket offices and the staff in these locations (presume LHR) were incapable of offering any help or alternative contact numbers as they tended to hang up on our calls.,Economy,1,4,1,1,2,1,2,2015,0
8276,11483,cathay-pacific-airways,Imogen Lau,United Kingdom,LHR-HKG-LHR. Seasoned traveller. Very disappointing service and food availability. Take-off delayed by over 2hrs due to 'troubleshooting' and only offered cups of lukewarm water after 1.5hrs of sitting on an uncomfortably warm full plane parked at the gate. First drinks service was very slow and ran out of a number of soft drinks (surprising as this was the first drinks service and we were in 5th row they served). Highly disappointed to be told during lunch service that had ran out of chicken (I reiterate we were in the 5th row they served) and only beef or vegetable pasta were available. More foresight needed when planning food demand or perhaps need better menu options if the majority of passengers were rejecting the beef? Food portions were also smaller than on other airlines and a mini KitKat does not constitute a 'dessert' when most other airlines would offer the KitKat as an addition to the 3 courses. No tea/coffee offered proactively after the lunch service needed to ask the FA for this. Only one meat option available again at dinner service (other meat option had again 'run out') or vegetable option. To their credit cabin crew were very apologetic and seemed almost embarrassed to tell us that it had happened again. Snacks counter was set up in the galley with a small assortment of sweet and savoury snacks that were regularly replenished. Cabin crew were very obliging when asked for non-alcoholic drinks. Seat seemed narrower than other airline economy seats and age-old problem once seat in front is fully-reclined does apply here; near impossible to reach my bag on the floor. Toilets were very clean and I did witness cabin crew doing regular checks of the facilities armed with air freshener. Inflight entertainment system was very good with many new movies available for viewing - adverts before every film/TV episode is annoying but you can fast forward through these. Overall poor flight experience but credit to good cabin crew. Only chose Cathay Pacific this time as flight time was more suited to my schedule but will definitely not choose Cathay over Emirates ever again.,Economy,6,2,4,2,5,2,7,2014,0

Big mistake we won't be making again. It was a long 7.5 hour trip when you are in economy class with very limited movement squeezed in like sardines in a can! No leg room and trust me we are not big people! Seats were like sitting on a thin wooden chair they were so thin and hard. Meals were very bland no taste and really not inviting should of eaten before the flight. Staff were okay did their job to the best of their abilities. Overall flight was good no roughness but really couldn't wait to get off as was so sore from sitting on the uncomfortable seats.

In November we accessed the advance seat selection and altered our seat allocation to window side seats in the A380 on both outbound and inbound flights. When checking in on the internet the day before departure we had been relocated to the middle seats on the way out and in separate seats on opposite sides of the aircraft on the way home. On complaining we were informed that I must have failed to complete the seat selection properly.

The aircraft was a 787 Dreamliner and I thought the seats were more comfortable than most. The entertainment system was solid but had a poor selection compared to the United flight I took on my way to Europe with about 3X the selection.

First flight delayed almost 2 hours of which the second hour was just waiting on the runway prior to kickoff. Other passengers said that on this route SGN-HAN-SGN delays are normal while to/from the provinces the airline appear to be much more punctual. Service onboard is absolutely minimal. One small bottle of water handed out is not impressive while a lot of idle FA's have nothing to do. To the 2 hour flight Hanoi to Saigon a sandwich was added. Nothing can be purchased to add to food or drinks. Other flights on time a bit dull not much to report.

The plane was only around 60% full so I had 2 seats to myself. The seats were a bit cramped so it would be uncomfortable if the flight was full. Very nice and friendly crew who chatted and socialized with the passengers.

7944,11150,british-airways,G Thompson,South Africa,Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,Premium Economy,9,5,4,4,5,4,7,2014,1

Since we booked with Lufthansa and paid regular prices and not with a cheap aircraft carrier this behaviour was outrageous! After we finally got our prints (just flight confirmations not boarding cards) we were told we would get the boarding passes at the gate. After asking a couple of times we got our boarding passes just to be told during boarding our daughter could not be seated with us because we were sitting in an emergency exit and she had to sit 7 rows behind us.

Pre drinks meal service and the cookie and milk prior to landing was super nice and very much felt like service on there international routes when AA is on point.

Difficult to make payment with non-Indonesian credit card. Cannot select seats online and no online check-in. Disorganized at airport in Bali where they basically re-entered all the data while checking in. Delayed flights. Onboard the absolute smallest legroom I've ever seen. Thankfully there are some positives as well: they have new 737-900ER's with Sky Interiors the flights are short and cheap and flight attendants have nice uniforms accompanied by wonderful smiles.

25191,38499,united-airlines,C Schultz,Germany,We booked a flight from SFO to LAX on United and a separate flight from LAX to Europe. Layover in LAX was supposed to be 5 hours - but rather safe than sorry is what I thought - and sorry we were to be: Upon entering the aircraft doors closed we were informed of a minor delay due to traffic restrictions. A while later a technical problem was added to the mix and they promised to keep us informed. It kept going on like this for a while until about two hours later we were released from the plane and tried to get on the next flight. After a total of three hours the ticketing agent kindly re-booked us on a Delta flight to LAX. We landed just in time to possibly make it on our next plane but the surprise was that our baggage was still on the original plane. So we had to wait even longer in LAX re-book the flight till next day find a hotel and so on. I asked UA ground crew if they could offer assistance with any of it hoping my star alliance gold card might come in handy. It certainly did not.

They offer cheaper rates but then add on $75 for one piece of luggage $25 for a carry-on $18 to select a seat plus all the taxes. Why don't they just make it a one fee and include everything?

I was lucky enough to fly on one of their newly retrofitted A330-200 from LHR to BAH. I was pleasantly surprised with the aircraft. The new seats were comfortable the IFE didn't have much choice but was the hardware was top quality. The touch screen unit had an USB port to charge personal devices too which was very useful. The aircraft was clean which you'd expect on a newly retrofitted aircraft. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The food was actually very nice but lacking in options. Being a red-eye flight there was at least 70% of the seats empty so I got some decent shut eye! The A320 from BAH to DXB was as full capacity as you'd expect for a regional flight. Again clean aircraft decent seats and helpful crew. The snack wasn't very appetizing.

7121,10097,british-airways,Kathleen Lee,Switzerland,Our flight on economy long distance from the Austin to Heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class.

The connecting flight to PTI was delayed as there was no fuel in the aircraft then an engine failed on start up. The Captain kept us informed as the engineers tried to fix it and an hour later we boarded a replacement airframe. On the return there was an hour delay at Philadelphia due to the aircraft being ""too hot in the cabin"" as it had been sat in the sun all day but the staff kept us informed of progress. What I did appreciate was that the bags went straight through and were ready to collect straight away.

23358,36051,thomas-cook-airlines,Ankers Graham,United Kingdom,Travelled to and from Turkey at the end of October - holiday from heaven but flights from hell. Paid extra for the extra leg room seats but I wonder why as these were of an inferior quality and actually seemed narrower than the normal seats. Don't get me wrong I didn't expect plush seats but I did expect a little more than we got and certainly expected that I would be able to put the table across my knee to eat my meal. The extra legroom seats were also made pointless as the cabin staff were constantly blocking the aisle so they could sell their wares thus causing passengers wanting to get to the toilets to congregate in the space that was sold as the extra leg room. Inflight film looked like it may have been worth a watch apart from the fact the screen was so far away you would need binoculars to watch it and to hear it would be impossible in the extra leg room seats as to plug in the over priced headphones would mean sawing your leg off. Food was hot but pretty much inedible (to me at least). Luckily the food was included in the package as it is definitely not worth bothering with. No choice in what you are served up - just get what they have left. Yes I will fly again with them but only because the hotel I like in Turkey can only be booked through them. Yes it is a budget airline but they don't half fleece you when they take £30 each way off you for the extra leg room seats that are not fit for purpose.,Economy,1,1,3,2,1,2,11,2013,0

Boarding in VIE was quite okay but the service onboard was not so good. After take-off they served us a hot meal but it was a very very small portion. Some pasta and 10g sweats (something like pudding) drink of our choice. It was a 3 hrs and 20 min flight so we got something to drink again before landing. Flying back from Yerevan to Vienna the boarding was awful disorganized. Because of these boarding procedures I had never had before we left for Vienna more than 61 mins delayed. Soon after take-off we got breakfast a very small one. Some scrambled eggs (I think not more than one egg/person) rolls and drinks.

The flight was overnight and for 5 of the 6 hour flight the fluorescent lights were left on making sleep nearly impossible. I booked the flight direct and they decided last minute to stop over in Montreal and pick up more passengers. Meaning from the time I boarded in Toronto I waited about 3 hours before I was served a lukewarm dinner which barely passed as edible. The flight crew were very nice however served extremely slow. My finished dinner was sitting in front of me for about 45 minutes before someone took it away. The plane itself was also not something I would pay for. The seats were extremely small (the smallest seats I have ever been on) and the aisles were so narrow I hit elbows the whole way down to the one of two washrooms onboard. Overall I was extremely dissatisfied with the experience. There's a reason the tickets are so cheap.

Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires.

On my return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne there was only one breakfast option on offer which was chicken sausage with scrambled eggs and this was the only meal which was below standard The egg was too runny and the spinach was burnt. Cabin crew on both flights were excellent and very friendly and spoke excellent English assisted me in putting my heavy suitcase into the overhead bin. Unlike the crew on some airlines who disappear right after the meal service the crew walked down the aisles with trays of water and juice after the cabin lights had been turned off and promptly bought me my scotch and coke when requested.

We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate.

21460,33066,spirit-airlines,Barbara Hafer,United States,I booked my trip then read the airline reviews and I was quite concerned. But I figured I was only flying from Baltimore to Myrtle Beach so how bad could it be for the cost - the cost of round trip for both my husband and myself including baggage was about $700 less than any other airline flying out of Baltimore how can you not take advantage of it. First the website clearly states about any additional baggage fees and carry on fees so people that were complaining about that just plainly did not read! I packed one checked bag for my husband and myself paid for it in advance and made sure it was under 40 pounds. For our personal baggage I had a large pocket book and he had his c-pap machine. I printed my boarding pass the day before our trip and let them assign our seat at no extra cost! We were assigned seats together! Arrived at the airport and was able to go right through to Fast Bag Drop since I paid for my checked bag in advance when purchasing our tickets. The person that checked us in couldn't have been any nicer! We ate breakfast at the airport then proceeded to wait for boarding which boarded on time and we took off about 6 minutes earlier since everyone was on board. Next our crew was excellent they provided some entertaining comments which I thought were quite refreshing. One hour later we were in Myrtle Beach. The morning we came home there was fog and our plane left about 1/2 hour later but still everyone was pleasant. The crew on the return flight wasn't as jovial as the flight down but no complaints. I would fly this airline again to Myrtle Beach and if taking a longer flight I would compare prices and make my judgement at that time. I think people just need to read. It's not like it's in fine print it plainly states their rules which I read thoroughly before booking.

1516,2244,air-canada,Richard Moller,Canada,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.,Economy,4,1,4,3,1,2,9,2014,0

Got a very good deal back in May which was only £100 more than my usual Etihad economy trip in economy for the dates. There were some good points to the trip but several bad points to mention. All flights on time except last leg back to Heathrow that was compensated though by my bag being first off. Lounge quality was varied which I'll review separately. LHR-Delhi on B777 - very good seat for sleeping (slept probably 7 hours) though privacy lacking. Good choice of drink selection but food for business class very poor in both presentation and quality. No amenity kits on board for overnight flight. Entertainment on demand but western choice limited with only 3 recent films. Delhi-BKK. Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time. Still could see the cost cutting with the amenity kit in business class being a cheap pair of flight socks and eye mask. No explanation given either of 90 minute delay.

Company changed their fees on June 1st and nobody had a courtesy to let me know that even though I am their top bonus member (frequent flyer program). I called before my flight to double check and asked if there is anything else I should be aware of (I flew with them few times before so I was familiar with their policies) and teller forgot to mention they changed baggage fees (from 50Euros to 200$). Customer service representative at the check in desk forgot to mention that too and she just transferred me to the cashier and it was than when I found out about the charge! I don't mind paying but I do mind being ripped off! Besides that their seats are very small and food quality could be better (a lot better).,Economy,2,1,3,2,3,1,8,2013,0

My family all had 'normal' food - lucky them, crackers for cheese and cheesecake dessert. I know there are Gluten free crackers around and I also know there are individual pot desserts. Breakfast was a yoghurt a fruit drink and a muffin, why couldn't I have a white bread roll with jam and butter and the muffin and juice?

4719,6440,alaska-airlines,Barbara A Hestdalen,Canada,Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.,First Class,2,1,4,3,1,2,3,2013,0

Food less than ordinary no tray but just main meal container (one was cracked) plus roll and envelope with cutlery etc. Overheard passenger asking cabin crew member to recommend which of the meal choices - the reply was ""Madam I would recommend eating before you board the plane""! The pre- landing snack was a sort of pizza contained in a thick cardboard box - made in England. Entertainment programme was minimal.

My flight from Cleveland To Vegas was delayed then returning the front desk attendant caused my husband and I to miss our flight. We had to get out of line to print boarding passes on the machines (which we didn't know because leaving Cleveland the machines were broken) - during the time we got out of line and input all the info needed on the computer a ticket printed saying see the front desk. We wait in line again get up to the desk and the attendant says we don't have enough time to make the flight. She wasted so much time giving us the run around then said we didn't have enough time to make it to the gate.  If she would have just printed our ticket we could have made it. The desk attendant decided that we were to leave in the next flight leaving 24 hrs later. No hotel accommodations or help.  I told my husband to ignore the reviews and to give it a chance and we did.

10512,15182,emirates,Jackson David,United Kingdom,BHX-DXB-BKK 1st April 2015 777 then A380 - EK 0384 and EK 0040. A Tale of Two Cities! The contrast between these two flights was vast so the data below is an average of both hence here is my review for each leg. Leg One Birmingham to Dubai. Plane full seats squashed leg room limited staff mainly rushed and miserable touch screen sensitivity useless. Leg Two Dubai to Birmingham. Plane full seats much larger in width and leg room wonderful attentive staff new screen with light touch sensitivity. No headphones provided to me. The price was £480 return with a return in July which was excellent and was much cheaper than from HRW with a better and shorter DXB layover of 2 hours. Would use again. Two gripes - advertisements at beginning of films and shows annoy me so an ability to just watch 20 seconds of a bit of each film in order to get the gist of it would be great I have no time to wade through numerous adverts just to eliminate 80% of the substandard films.

7230,10208,british-airways,G Scholes,United Kingdom,DEL-LHR BA 256. Seats 17AB downstairs in business class in B747-400 G-BNLY. The aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained. Her age was most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. I have become used to the clarity of modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. I have made several long haul flights with BA in Business Class recently and have decided that I don't like the standard BA model business class seat. There is nowhere to put small items like glasses pens landing cards and so on. There is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. There is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level. At the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat. It is not strong and so can not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. Clunky and peculiar to BA it is not a design feature that enhances the seat. Individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space. Thoughts about coffins come to mind. When the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit. Seat 17B was a poor choice. It is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. On the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded.,Business Class,6,3,4,4,2,3,4,2015,1

We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security).

FA's were brilliant professional attentive actually charming and regularly present in the cabin with drinks sandwiches snacks ice-cream etc. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasars's Salad. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. LX uses the shared Servisair lounge in AMS which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a neglectable food selection. Due to the short connection time in ZRH we did not use lounge in ZRH. Transferring in ZRH is fast and easy. Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other Schengen countries a breeze. Terminals are roomy and well designed. Probably one of the very best airports in Europe for a transfer connection. Excellent long-haul product by LX and clearly recommended.

8768,12063,china-eastern-airlines,H Kaaber,United Kingdom,Flew LHR-PDG-SYD and returned three weeks later. Was somewhat tentative given some of the reviews on here but the price was at least £200 cheaper than next best fare. Needn't have worried the flights were punctual on all legs the planes were very clean and the attendants very helpful albeit some have limited English. The food was good though best on the legs from LHR and from SYD to PDG. IFE was excellent with a wide range of films and games. The flight booked for the return leg was changed three months prior to flying and we were informed by email. We left SYD later in the day and were accommodated in the airport hotel overnight in Shanghai which broke the journey up nicely.

26683,40316,virgin-australia,F Waller,Australia,MEL to Bali. Plane flight and cabin crew all good. Entertainment was zero - no movies no screens no radio. Luckily had an ipads ready pre-loaded. Biggest Issue - Food and drinks. Or lack thereof. Whole family starving so whilst waiting for main meal we wanted to order from the Virgin inflight menu which was poor but we were hungry and happy to pay for the limited morsels on the menu. However there was no food to be ordered. After a long wait the main finally arrived which was fine. The price of the flight was not cheap and it's a 6 hour flight so I think Virgin are skating on thin ice here and should at least warn customers of what to expect.,Economy,4,2,4,1,1,2,7,2013,0

I have never experienced such an uncomfortable seat in my life. Plane looked old on both ways, cleanliness was ok. Very poor entertainment choices, not many movies, old and bad screen, and only one episode from each of the tv series. Food was ok. On the outbound plane was almost empty, so the service was great, we could order lots of drinks and the crew were very nice. Full plane on the inbound with poor service, on an 8 hour flight they came by twice, and the breakfast was awful.

Service was poor - never came back when I requested another glass of wine and looked like they didn't want too help. They only smile if you speak Hebrew! Seats were cramped. Food was actually ok but not special - a bowl of hummus and pitta but no beer! Additional security hassles - again if you don't speak Hebrew they will give you an additional grilling in a pointless and child like way possibly searching you as well.

My entertainment system didn't work properly neither did my sons and the man sitting next to me - his didn't work at all. The food was barely edible. Staff were nice and helpful. The return was in a much newer nicer plane. The entertainment system worked well and the seats were much better. The food was genuinely inedible.

Other things were good as usual including the ever-smiling and helpful cabin crew. One suggestion though. Please stop further cutting corners on food to save costs. The snack pack is so thin already.

There were flight attendants shouting at people and when I asked for water I was told very rudely to wait. Mumbai airport was an utter nightmare with men and women searched and separated upon landing not to mention the mosquitoes which were everywhere.

Service and food quality on outbound portion from Newark was much better than on return to Miami. Quality and service seems to be luck of the draw and inconsistent. I booked the flights 8 ght months in advance and originally booked Miami to Lisbon on the outbound portion. They cancelled the outbound flight from Miami but did not notify me. I found out 5 days before departure by calling the airline to reconfirm everything. Fortunately I was able to rebook out of Newark for the same day of departure although this entailed an 8 hour layover in Lisbon for the continuing flight on to Funchal. The only other glaring negative was the food service on the return portion from Lisbon. The food was really poor. ""Priority"" luggage came off the airplane last in Miami.

Firstly it wouldn't let us check in online instead confirming that we were on stand-by. Naturally this caused us concerns so we enquired on arrival at Sao Paulo to be told that this was because when we flew out to Sao Paulo we paid extra for exit seats. So essentially they inconvenienced us just so they could try to upsell these exit seats again. Thank you TAM. The check-in clerk was very friendly anyway so that was good. Boarding was utter chaos. The time between boarding starting and the plane starting to taxi was two hours! I don't remember ever having had a flight like it. The seats were hideously uncomfortable as ever and the IFE extremely limited unless you wish to watch hundreds of episodes of Downton Abbey.

A very surly and officious staff member at Heathrow check-in who was supposedly there to direct people to the right queue amidst the usual chaos was the only other negative point. Coming back crew were excellent and patient with a number of demanding passengers. Food on both journeys was very good. Legroom was shocking.

I am a frequent flyer all over the FlyBe network and I have to say to begin with that flybe is a great company in which I have had no problems with Loganair (a franchise partner) is a whole different story. This is in regards to my most recent trip from Manchester to Glasgow which was operated by Loganair the flight was on time so there was no issue there but the aircraft a Saab 2000 (SB20) was in a very bad state clearly very old in poor condition and filthy! The complimentary drinks which I guess is why the fare was much more expensive than usual was a tiny cup of lukewarm coffee and the caramel biscuit was almost five months past the best before date (November 14) my flight was end of March 2015. The crew were completely disinterested and clearly wanted to get back to Glasgow so that they could have the rest of the day off. I shall never use any flight operated by Loganair again and this airline is a disgrace to the FlyBe brand. The price for this flight operated by FlyBe is only around £30 one way but with Loganair is around £80. until FlyBe use their own aircraft and crew on this route I suggest that you should use the train - I know that I shall.,Economy,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2015,0

Flight was 99% full and ground staff and FA's were efficient with the boarding process and managed to get everyone seated in time (despite the large amount of duty free items brought on board). There were a lot of Chinese/Thai flight attendants to deal with the Chinese/Thai speaking passengers. Hand luggage size rules were (generally) obeyed by passengers. Flight arrived about an hour early. FA's were friendly and had good English. Good selection of beverages (and generous amounts). Food was also good. Leg room and seat width was adequate. Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service. Overall good for an African airline and has improved over the past years but needs a few more finishing touches before it is on par with a lot of other major international carriers.

About 50% of the cabin had the same issues. How hard is it to test the system beforehand? Or upgrade to a system that works. On the way to Narita we were both stuck with the Japanese meal being at the back of the plane. Was awful. On the return flight back we managed to get seats in the front of the plane and had a much better meal. Still 1 out of 2 inflight systems did not work properly only a couple of movies worked.

Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendants…- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable.

We queried this with the customer services and were told in Washington that they do supply food on interior (domestic) flights shame we were not informed of this before we flew with them. We changed our flight from Newark New York when we arrived at Heathrow at the start of our holiday because they asked us if we would obviously New York was overbooked which resulted in us missing our connection to Las Vegas. They were unhelpful at Houston and put us on Standby. We thought the cabin crew were scruffy unhelpful and lazy.

The security briefing was uninspiring to say the least an airline of Ariks size should really use a video people had to move their heads and practically get out of their seats to see what the crew member was doing and the person with the script had trouble with reading it. The inflight entertainment system didn't work and the staff didn't seem to care they were not apologetic or surprised it made me wonder when last it had worked. The staff were very unprofessional not courtesy in the way the addressed customers they didn't offer any extra drinks or snacks for the duration of the flight until they served breakfast.

Seat covers were worn carpets dirty and stained tray was cracked and the LCD monitors had a poor picture quality. Cabin staff were quite terse with passengers and a few did not have a good command of English. I asked for a dark rum and coke. The stewardess started pouring a bacardi and lemonade. Advised her twice it was the wrong drink but she ignored me. Passenger next to me asked for a can of lager and had to repeat himself three times before I pointed to a can of beer. Food was barely edible with undercooked chicken and stale rolls. KL to LHR leg on the new A380's was better. Planes are new and staff made an effort to be friendly. food was OK but only 3 drinks offered on a 13 hour flight. passengers were constantly asking cabin crew for water to stop dehydration. Check in staff at AKL was rather chaotic and some leadership is required to deal with passengers with excess luggage who were constantly holding up the queue. Disappointed that passengers relatives were wandering in and out of supposedly off limits check in area. Check in staff at London were terse and did not greet me with a hello or thank you.

12834,18334,frontier-airlines,R Carter,United States,On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.,Economy,1,1,1,1,1,2,12,2013,0

I was driven to the departure gate in a buggy a lovely gesture indeed. Overall Air France certainly knows how to define first class service. I have flown first class long haul with three other airlines before and not one could match the service of La Premiere with Air France. If I wanted to be critical there are some minor details. Firstly the cost is much higher than most other airlines. Secondly there is no complimentary limousine service to and from the airport. Thirdly they may need to provide a more extensive menu to cater for people who are originally from the region in South East Asia.,First Class,9,5,4,3,4,3,5,2015,1
19806,29338,qatar-airways,Ian Lancaster,United Kingdom,TRV-DOH-LHR Nov 12 Business. My first Qatar flight taking advantage of the airline joining OneWorld. And in one word - excellent. A320 (or was it 321?) out of Trivandrum to Doha big comfortable seat - a proper business/1st class seat not a pretend one like most airlines use on their single-aisle short-haul aircraft. A 50-minute transfer in Doha which went very smoothly (would I have made it if I'd had baggage or been in economy?) and a lie-flat seat on a 777 to LHR. Very attentive FAs decent food excellent AVOD on time (actually half-hour early in to LHR thanks to wind).,Business Class,10,5,5,4,5,5,11,2013,1

In March 2014 this flight became a rouge route - and this is not what I purchased originally. Rouge seats service IFE are not the same.

15162,22643,kenya-airways,M Levy,United Kingdom,Nairobi-LHR. I recently was unfortunate to have flown Kenya Airways. Flying Nairobi to Heathrow on the 23.45 flight we were told after we had all proceeded through the gate that it had been cancelled. This was at midnight. 2 staff were available to book over 200 people onto new flights. They were slow rude and lied about when they were able to do. They were very slow to provide any refreshments and were not able to accommodate everyone in hotels until the flights the following day - so we had to sleep on the floor. When I finally got a flight home the food was substandard the staff were rude and surly. Toilets were not cleaned or maintained. I will never be flying this airline again.,Economy,4,1,1,1,1,1,10,2011,0

An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,Economy,8,4,4,4,2,3,12,2013,1

Flight attendants were experienced and efficient friendly and accommodating. Video selections a bit odd but interesting with plenty of choices.

It started with 2 flight attendance who decided it would ok to argue with each other in front of us as one raised her voice to the other while the second mumbled under her breath and stomped off. After getting strapped in we were treated to a 70 minute wait with no explanation as to why we were not moving. Finally the cabin door opened and ground crew took some paperwork from the pilots and raced off back to the terminal only to wait a further 15 minutes before we could head off.

21850,34075,sunwing-airlines,M Stephens,Canada,My issue stems from what is essentially a bait and switch scheme used by the carrier. On September 28 2013 I paid for a direct flight from Vancouver BC to Huatulco Mexico leaving March 18 2014. On February 10 2014 by email the carrier changed the flight to include a stopover in Calgary effectively adding over three hours on the plane each way. Sunwings position is that I got a direct flight as I did not change planes in Calgary and that what I was really looking for was a non-stop flight. Notwithstanding that from a travellers point of view the difference in nomenclature is without distinction. It effectively says do not rely on Sunwings advertised flight schedules. I paid a premium price for a direct flight. I did not receive what I paid for.,Economy,1,1,2,1,1,2,5,2014,0

26901,40608,vueling-airlines,C Hermoso,Switzerland,I used 2 Vueling flights yesterday between Seville-Barcelona and Barcelona-Zurich. The first flight was of a good standard as good or better than easyJet but the second leg of the flight was not what one would expect from a established serious airline. The boarding at Barcelona into a sub-contracted plane from Orbest (grupo Barcelo) was badly organized by unmotivated/poorly trained ground staff the leg room between seats was smaller that in the Seville flight the cabin staff could not cope with the overall services provided (printed prices for food/drinks were for Orbest passengers) they could not provide cold Cava and instead of published Orbest prices higher Vueling prices were charged. Flight left 15 mins late and docking gate at Zurich was at the far end of the runway (20 min walk to the exit. The whole flight was a very poor experience and poor value for money. I believe passengers should be refunded part of their original Vueling ticket cost when a sub-optimum alternative flight arrangement is provided. I shall give Vueling flights a rest for a while and will continue using easyJet which is run in a more professional manner.,Economy,2,1,2,2,0,0,8,2014,0
16442,24548,lufthansa,M Tushishvili,France,I had the flight Paris-Tirana-Paris via Munich last month. Lufthansa offers very good European product. Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.,Economy,8,5,5,2,1,4,12,2014,1
25886,39343,vietnam-airlines,B Akpabio,United Kingdom,Flew London to Hanoi and Saigon to London both in business. As a counter to some of the negative reviews both flights were excellent. Sure the cabin felt a bit tired and there was no lie flat bed but food and drink were good and plentiful and service both ways particularly the return was incredibly attentive. The entertainment was limited. Outbound we were offered iPads which were far superior to the armrest screens on the return. Nice touches included dedicated business class buses to and from the aircraft. All in all I had an excellent experience. If you go expecting something comparable to one of the five star airlines you may be disappointed but it was good value and will happily travel with them again.,Business Class,9,4,5,5,3,5,11,2014,1
25865,39320,virgin-america,Gilbert Schwartz,United States,Flew SFO-FLL on 3/17/14 first class (seats 1 AB). Check-in at SFO was fast and efficient and took only a few minutes with no one in front of us. The lounge at SFO is futuristic but unattractive with an overdose of reds and blacks and uncomfortable seating. Boarding was quick with no problem. The flight crew was aloof and seemed preoccupied. They all wear street clothes. Although well attired - no uniforms? It appears very unprofessional and exudes little confidence. There is no closet for garments. I was told to store my jacket in the overhead bin - really? In first class? Food service was mediocre at best. A choice of two appetizers and two entrees. We ordered the rice noodles main course and as I don't expect anything close to gourmet food the food was cold and inedible. The flight attendant was nowhere to be found although seen frequently during the flight sitting in the jump seat in the galley. Although dessert was included as part of the meal service none was provided. I emailed customer service with my comments and received no reply which I find inexcusable.,First Class,2,3,2,2,4,3,4,2014,0

What is it with airlines that give you a middle seat spare but otherwise everything else is economy. Seat pitch - about 30 inches at best no inflight entertainment some abysmal horrible tasting fish in an inedible orange sauce of some sort and the person in front reclining into your face.

10294,14856,emirates,Joern Sauer,Australia,"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",Economy,1,2,1,1,3,2,7,2015,0

On outbound flight from Malta hand luggage was weighed (first time this has happened in business class) apparently due to ""a change in procedures"". My ten year old daughters were asked their age in the La Vallette lounge despite having business class tickets and there was little room for luggage by the time we boarded the plane. Breakfast on board was a sad affair with the nasty frankfurter sausage having made an unwelcome return. The Crew however were fine. The return flight out of LHR was less joyous. We were treated to an unintentional and lengthy display of origami by the check-in agent writing folding our lounge invitations (Why cannot the boarding passes simply be used for lounge access?) and a whole wad of questions about my wife's visa which is perfectly valid. Thank goodness for the Etihad lounge - a truly professional and quality experience but the joy ended there. The flight was full and service was very slow with dinner not being served until we were well over Nice. When it came the chicken was tough and overcooked and the dessert was unrecognizable either by looks or by taste. The stewardess was stretched whilst the purser sat behind the curtain doing absolutely nothing until late into the flight. Wine and Champagne were all served in tumblers (a pet hate) and the seats themselves are very uncomfortable for a flight where most passengers want to sleep. Priority luggage on Air Malta is also a joke when it comes off with all the other luggage. This is not unique to Air Malta but on a recent Emirates flight it really worked properly.

When finally on the Avro RJ85 aircraft we had to wait for the plane to be defrosted for over 45 mins and then we were put to the end of the queue for take-off.

We are both registered disabled with mobility problems - at Heathrow check-in we were promised 3 seats in order for us to stretch our legs. On both flights we were given 1 seat each rows apart with hardly any leg room. The seatbelt light was kept on most of the 1st long-haul flight so we weren't able to stand or use the toilet for hours at a time. The trip back was a dream the cabin crews were so attentive and on the Delhi to London leg we were both given 4 seats at the back so we could lie down. My advice to anyone with a disability would be to email customer services prior to booking detailing your needs.

This is one of the worst airlines that I have travelled on. The staff looked tired and unhappy they WERE unhelpful and unfriendly - flight nanny only seen once. Food horrible service non-existent. This was very disappointing because I have travelled with this airline before. When leaving the aircraft I said to the male attendant this was one of the worst flights I have had his reply was have a nice day.,Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,2015,0

The cabin director found out it was my Dad's 60th birthday and gave him a bottle of champagne to take away. Very friendly and nothing too much trouble. We flew on older 747 and newer 777 with latest interior - both very comfortable plenty of leg room and entertainment great. Screen on older aircraft a little small but much better on newer. Food was the best I had on any airline. Restaurant quality without a doubt.,Premium Economy,10,5,5,5,4,5,7,2014,1

A330 rather new good and generous catering decent IFE but most of all excellent crew who seem to spot passengers in economy with FF-status. KLM beats Lufthansa hands down in this route in flying experience a pity they do not fly to Almaty daily. Already alone for the crew experience I would not doubt to fly KLM again.,Premium Economy,9,4,5,4,3,5,8,2013,1
8639,11906,china-airlines,P Pomeranze,United States,Beijing to Shanghai Business Class June 21. Despite both ATC and weather delays (neither of which were the carriers fault) we had a really good experience. Flight was operated by an A330 which was internationally configured as it was continuing to Melbourne. Very comfortable seating good entertainment including camera's and maps and a very decent snack. Crew were efficient and kind although not overly warm and they were inconsistent in their enforcement of safety regulations i.e. Cell phones on and seat backs up. The female crews seemed hesitant to enforce correct behavior of Chinese men. All in all a very good professional experience.,Business Class,9,5,4,4,5,5,6,2014,1
25236,38556,united-airlines,L Hollaway,United States,I flew UA Spokane WA to Denver CO and flight staff were late for work so slight delay. Plane was crowded but staff pleasant. Got to Denver landed at Gate B1 and had to run to Gate B95 because I had 5 mins to catch my next flight also UA. Finally got to my gate to find it was changed and there was a delay for half an hour. This turned into a two hour delay as they kept extending it. Plane was very crowded and tiny seats staff were friendly enough served cold coffee. I was lucky as everyone I sat with had a UA flying horror story. All in all it could have been worse. I thought staff being late was rather tacky. I think I will fly Delta next time.,Economy,3,1,4,3,1,2,7,2014,0
27280,41210,wizz-air,J Leigh,United Kingdom,I travelled from Bourgas/Luton 2 weeks ago on what seemed like a new plane. It was the most uncomfortable ride I have had on a plane. The seats did not recline and you were sat upright all the time. The leg room has been cut down they have done away with then recess to put your bits and pieces in and the food tray has no dip for a drink consequently drinks are sliding about all the time and you are forced to hold it in your hand. The seats were not made of fabric but some kind of leatherette material and were hard. All this I presume is to get a few more seats in and make more money.,Economy,2,1,3,3,0,2,10,2012,0

17400,25754,malaysia-airlines,J Teoh,Australia,LHR-KUL-SYD in Business class. LHR-KUL on the A380. Check-in agent at LHR very friendly and advised of fast-track through security and location of lounge. First class lounge (due to OneWorld Emerald status) very nice with great views of the tarmac and having a good selection of food at the buffet stand. A-la-carte menu was of excellent quality. The staff at the lounge were very helpful friendly and accommodating making the experience a complete pleasure. Priority boarding not quite what it should be as there is a boarding gate for business class passengers and economy passengers on the upper deck who board together and a separate boarding gate for first class passengers and economy passengers on the lower deck. Despite this boarding was relatively quick orderly and efficient. Non-alcoholic pre- departure drinks offered. Flight was delayed due to a crew member being injured prior to departure and they had to wait for a replacement crew to arrive. Seat was very comfortable in both the sitting and flat positions. There was also plenty of storage space for personal items. Good selection of IFE with a reasonable amount of latest releases. Cabin crew were excellent on this sector. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Pre-ordered meal through their Chef-on-call service was honoured. Quality of meals on this sector was quite good. Flight arrived late into KUL but some time was made up in the air. However it meant that the connection for the flight to SYD was still a bit tight. KUL-SYD was on a new A330-300. This flight was held back to ensure that connecting passengers and their luggage made it onto the flight which was much appreciated. Cabin crew again were great on this flight. My pre- ordered meal was honoured and it was excellent. This was probably the best steak I've ever had in the air! The satay of course was excellent. IFE similar to what was on offer on the A380 flight from LHR to KUL. The seat is comfortable in the sitting position but not so much in the angled flat position. Storage space for personal items is very poor on these seats. Flight arrived an hour late into SYD. Check-in luggage did make it through but did not come out first. However I was just glad that the luggage made it to SYD. Overall a great experience and one that I will continue to use due to the consistency of service standards and good value for money.,Business Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,11,2013,1

Cabin crews were helpful and friendly. Improving points were reservation center staffs and ground handling. I contacted reservation centers in Addis Ababa several times by e-mail with a quick answer. Addis Ababa airport is chaos. I really felt that ground staff tried to take care of passengers but absolutely too many passengers for the number of staff.

11314,16091,etihad-airways,C Slater,Australia,SYD-AUH-GRU R/T. Overall a disappointing experience with Etihad. We flew with our infant and had seen before buying the tickets that they provide an Inflight nanny service (Flying Nanny) on all flights so if you need help with your children they will be there to assist (major selling point). How wrong we were! There was no meet and greet onboard with the nanny and very little assistance (if any) was on hand while in flight. More assistance was given by fellow passengers when the wife was travelling alone with him on the first two sectors. AUH-SYD leg there were 6 infants in the small front economy class section of the 777 and not once did I see the nanny there. I did see her in the rear galley when I wanted the bottle cleaned but she was more interested turning her back and scoffing down her meal while a flight attendant helped. At Abu Dhabi there was no special boarding for infants or children. Meals seat and inflight entertainment were average at best. I couldn't find anything outstanding with this airline except it was the cheapest price we could find on this route. We have vowed not to fly with Etihad again.,Economy,5,2,2,2,3,4,1,2015,0

9585,13107,copa-airlines,J Vasco de Quiroga,United States,The fleet is aged and well worn with perhaps only a dozen or so newer planes in service. Given the ratio of new vs. older equipment it is probable that you will be flying on one of their older planes. Such was the case on my recent journey to South America - LAX-GIG / GRU-LAX. The business class seats were old recliner types much like old first class seat of the 70's-80's. The IFE was past its prime with minimal choices and poor music options. Food service while good was not up to premium class standards. The inflight crew was top notch on all legs of my trip. In short the fare was cheapest business class for my itinerary and the minimal connection times in PTY did not require a sprint to the gate. All flights departed and arrived on time. Would I fly with them again? Possibly so but I might consider paying the extra bucks to fly a carrier that offers a more up-to-date comfortable business class.,Business Class,6,3,5,4,2,4,12,2014,1

When we presented our boarding passes we were told that our seats were cancelled as they didn't think we would make the flight. I was traveling with my elderly mother so I insisted that they get us on that flight. In the end they found seats for most of us but I had to sit separately from my mother and kids. To add insult to injury some people did not get on the flight although there were still empty seats. They cancelled our seats and put us all through turmoil for nothing.

Along with at least 100 other passengers we stood in line for more than 3 hours waiting for some sort of assistance in booking another flight. There was only 1 clerk working the desk and he was not only overwhelmed but highly inefficient. Passengers from other Spirit flights who were desperately trying to drop off bags so they would not miss THEIR flights were finally shifted to another line and the lone clerk at the desk set about helping them-leaving the rest of us to stand and wait yet again. We finally gave up and booked a flight on another airline (which we suspect was what Spirit hoped we'd do so they wouldn't have to deal with the problem) because we had commitments in Detroit that could not be altered. Even after numerous calls and emails to Spirit we were never offered any assistance or compensation of any kind (not even a meal voucher) for our trouble.,Economy,1,1,1,1,2,1,5,2015,0

Ground staff at MEL airport were polite and assisted with checking our two bags (under my name) onto the flight. The flight attendants boarding the flight at the gate were extremely rude yelling at passengers to move forward in the long queue. Once onboard the service was better and the crew were quite friendly at times offering to retrieve bags from the overhead compartment. One of my bags didn't arrive in Brisbane - which is curious because it was checked in at the same time as the other bag. I was told that it didn't make it onto the flight and that they would only be able to send it by courier the next day.

The flight was delayed by 11 hours due to pilot problems. When we finally boarded we were greeted by very young and in all likelihood very inexperienced staff. The plane was old and very cramped. When we finally landed in Toronto  I then had a 6 hour wait to get my connecting flight to Vancouver. I thought that this was all just an unfortunate problem in the delay but lo and behold my daughter took the same Air Canada Rouge flight from Dublin three weeks later and was delayed taking off by 4 hours and missed her connecting flight. Less than one week after her flight I happened to be flying in from London Heathrow at 3pm and guess what the air Canada Rouge flight which was supposed to have taken off at 12.10 was still sitting in Dublin airport. I will never fly with Rouge again and I think Air Canada need to look at this whole off shoot airline.

Being stuck overnight away from home Virgin Australia refused to book me a hotel or give me vouchers for a taxi to get to a place to stay. They told me to my face 'you are not a highly valued customer'. When I asked if I did not matter at all the member of ground staff told me that she didn't know how to explain their policy.

Left on time and a short run to the end of the runway for a speedy departure. Then came breakfast which used to be good but us now a disaster.

They have nice planes great staff the lounges are wonderful but their reliability makes me hesitant to use them again. More's the pity because it could be the best airline in North America. The flight from Newark to Toronto was on time and the service was faultless. On arrival in Toronto all looked okay for the next leg to Sudbury but then that flight was cancelled because of maintenance issues. I was shifted to a later flight scheduled to depart four hours later but was delayed by a further two hours. Many other flights were also delayed. Credit goes to the cabin crew on this flight for maintaining a positive demeanour despite being faced with a very grumpy passenger load. Based on comments I heard on the aircraft and have read on here cancellations and long delays have become commonplace at Porter. I think this airline is perhaps growing too fast and its aircraft inventory is too small to cope with anything but one of those extremely rare days when nothing goes wrong. It really needs to focus more on reliability.,Economy,4,4,5,5,0,4,11,2014,0

Not comparable to a ""normal airline"" watch out! Flew from LGW to JFK. I am quite tall and the seat spacing is on par with Ryanair for local flights. For an 8hr intercontinental flight this is torture. In addition the ""pre-booked"" meal thing means I had no food for most of the flight. There is no good warning about this before you book. Prices for snacks etc. are ludicrous even for in-air standards. Flight delayed 1h which is not a lot in the grand scheme of things but if you don't fit in the seat it is certainly an added bonus. My point is: the flight is terrible if you are not really small even when the ""Dreamliner"" is available and you are not delayed. If you really must compare on price make sure to add another 100 pounds for luggage/meal. Then factor in that you get much more space in the economy class of other airlines.",Economy,1,1,3,1,2,2,9,2014,0

The ground and onboard staff were very friendly all 4 flights nearly on time and the cabin of the Airbus clean. When seated in one of the front rows space is ample otherwise quite cramped. The disadvantage is that Iberia charges for food and beverages even on continental flights.,Economy,6,3,5,3,0,4,1,2013,1

Seated in World Traveller on the upper deck. 2x4x2 on this deck is preferable to the 3x4x3 on the lower deck. Flight attendants welcome customers on board and service was friendly and professional. Seat fairly comfortable. Legroom standard for economy. IFE excellent; a huge range of entertainment options. The disappointment was lunch.

11446,16239,etihad-airways,Searle Wendy,Australia,We flew from Sydney to London Heathrow. First part of the flight was code shared with Virgin Australia. This was a 14 hour flight to Abu Dhabi and was fantastic. Unfortunately that's where it ends. From Abu Dhabi to London was dreadful. The seats were so small that one felt claustrophobic. My husband and I were in the middle and aisle seat. We had a well built young lady sat next to us who also filled in half of my husbands seat. (He sat in the middle). The food was horrible. As it was a night flight we were given a breakfast bag consisting of a bread roll filled with meat an orange popper and a fig filled cake. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and not only looked unappetising but tasted it too. On the return journey back we had the same kind of flight to Abu Dhabi which once again was dreadful. The flight attendants all looked miserable and the service was so slow. The empty meal containers were not cleared away for ages and nobody seemed interested if you rang for service. All in all I would not fly Etihad again.

First the plane left with a delay of about 45 minutes after 2 hours in the air the airplane was detoured back to Montreal due to mechanical problem. Back in Montreal we encountered nothing but rude and useless staff. I had to pay for a cab and Air Canada only offered a voucher for 10 dollars. Next day the same aircraft was used to resume the trip. The returning flight Geneva-Montreal was also cancelled due to mechanical issues and it was the same aircraft. I lost it at the airport when the useless staff just give me a new flight for next day without even try to look for an alternative flight (several flights going to Paris for instance). I had to call customer service in Canada to change another flight also with Air Canada to South America. Long story short try another company and do not spend you money on this company.

During my last trip to Athens for the outbound flight they put two flights together - as a result I was not able to change flights online. Hence I had to call them up in order to change flights they inform that I had to pay an extra 65 euros if I wanted to fly in a particular flight and 20 euro if I wanted to fly with another flight.

We were very underwhelmed by the experience. The headrests weren't clean food and service were average and the basins in the business class toilets didn't work for the entire 14 hour flight - it felt more like premium economy. Compared to other business class services that we had experienced this was at the low end. One redeeming feature - plane was on time and we made our connection to London - again on Swiss. The connecting Swiss flight to London was also business class and the service and food were much improved - and the toilet basins worked.,Business Class,3,3,3,2,3,2,12,2013,0

Mobile boarding pass is very helpful. Boarding was quick and easy. Flight operated by Shuttle America E-170. The plane was very comfortable with lots of legroom in standard economy. I am 6' and had no problem. Return was equally as easy. St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights. I arrived an hour be fore both flights but could have got there much later.

We managed to reach the airport with little sleep and were boarded on our plane at 10.30am. We were onboard but were then taken off the plane due to a flat tyre. They told us they would try to fix the issue and then we were told that we were going to fly out that day. After waiting at the airport until 3.30pm they told us the flight was cancelled until the next day. They put us up in a hotel but only one room per booking.

26669,40299,virgin-atlantic-airways,A Smith,New Zealand,"By far one of the worst flights I've had. Flew PVG-LHR on one of the A340-600 in 60K (G-VWEB). I'm 5"" 8' so not the largest person in the world and yet my knees were being poked the entire flight by the pocket from the seat in front of me. Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it. At least they came around at reasonable times with it and offered drinks fairly often during the flight. Also the lack of any form of power is annoying not even a USB port for plugging a phone/tablet into.",Economy,1,1,2,1,1,2,4,2014,0

Seats were most comfortable and sufficient leg room with the IES being truly amazing and certainly scored a 10 out of 10 from me. The food was very good ex SYD however on the return journey ex LAX it was not so enjoyable. I have travelled this route before many times in the past with Qantas but felt that the service on VA was superior in every way and so much more personalised. First time also on the Boeing 777 and I much prefer this aircraft type than the larger alternative.

Given other reviews about this airline I was concerned about flying BG Air at first and was in the end decently surprised about the flight - My flight was operated by an Airbus A319. The flight attendants were extremely kind and helpful yet spoke below average English. The food on board consisted of an extremely tasty sandwich accompanied by a chocolate as Dessert which was also tasty. Two rounds of drinks were served on this flight. The flight was full and uneventful. The aircraft required better cleaning.

My travel started on April 1st on UA 5 from London to Houston. I'm a 1k and upgraded this whole itinerary of about 48000 miles of travel from economy to business using mileage and a cash fee. All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule.

Pity the poor people who squeezed their way to the self check in and bag tagged their bags only to be told to join the same line. I can not understand how the system is supposed to be more efficient. We then had the situation of BA staff dragging people out of the line as they were going to miss their flight. Even the very nice BA staff member who did our bag tags could not explain what went wrong. Flight was delayed on boarding due to flight coming in late. No issue with boarding or the staff on board all very helpful. We have a drink and wrap which was very good. Captain kept us informed of the delay and we landed 30 mins late and he did apologise again for late arrival. Please Gatwick BA sort out check in.,Economy,9,5,5,4,1,5,8,2014,1
27231,41099,virgin-atlantic-airways,Illenberger Joachim,Germany,JFK-LHR (final destination HAM) on VS 046 (747-400) as a family of 5 including one infant. Check-in in JFK took 30 min. I asked for information on how to transfer from T3 to T5 at LHR but no info was available. At the gate in JFK we handed over our stroller to ground staff for delivery at a/c in LHR. In the a/c eventually we were then told that at LHR strollers are only delivered at the baggage belt and never at aircraft. Well our stroller is still missing. Shortly after take-off we asked for a baby bassinet. It was only then that cabin crew advised us that our daughter is 1kg over the 9kg bassinet-limit so we won't be able to use it. Meal quality is what it is for Economy Class - nothing wrong about that. Surprised to see that cabin crew would not go around to distribute water or sodas during the night. Astonished by the general behaviour of most of the cabin crew: mainly impudent sloppy and almost rude. To summarise it was a pretty lousy experience and a big disappointment for me as I always thought very highly of VS and their product strategies. Instead of service trained cabin crew we had the impression to be taken care of by a crew of teenage girls in uniforms. While the IFE is very comprehensive (but nothing extraordinary anymore compared to today's standard) the human contact still is the most important part of product quality in the airline business and this is were in my view VS failed completely.,Economy,2,1,1,2,3,2,8,2013,0

I am a Qantas Gold Frequent Flyer and had originally booked Economy but I upgraded to Business for the first leg and then received further upgrades on subsequent flights. Second time I have flown Emirates and was very impressed. Easy check-in in Sydney and Sao Paulo and transit in Dubai very easy. Found all staff both inflight and on ground extremely friendly and helpful. Meals on all flights were excellent with a wide variety of choices - all accompanied by some excellent wines. The ICE - entertainment system offered incredibly varied options of entertainment. My only complaint was the angled lie flat bed on the B777-300 - I have a real thing about angled lie flat bed. Luggage arrived quickly and the ""Priority"" tag seemed if it actually meant something with Emirates - I am sure it is for appearance factor only on other airlines.

Departure delayed by a couple of tardy business class pax then we taxied around for nearly 1 hour before take-off because we missed our slot. Dinner was excellent and just as I was thinking an ice cream would really top this off they came round with ice cream except if you had ordered a special meal then you aren't eligible! (luckily some other people declined so they found me one but why skimp on this?). Breakfast was a bit minimal. Recaro seats not too bad but the footrest is annoying and a couple more inches of leg room would have been nice.

Flew business class between Melbourne and Wellington recently and was more than impressed with the quality of the food and service. Lounges for Trans-Tasman flights are shared with Air New Zealand which are both very good in Melbourne and Wellington. Recent trips to Sydney and return have also been impressive. Nice apple muffin served and water, juice tea or coffee offered and due to Platinum status seating in row 3 a bonus. The other thing about VA is their turn-around time which is pretty quick. Often seated at Departure gate and watch passengers disembarking and in what seems no time at all you are being boarded for your flight. Staff are always friendly and helpful.

15357,22909,jetstar-airways,Nicola Painter,New Zealand,On the 12 August we eventually flew Auckland to Singapore. The flight was meant to leave at 10.15am. So we arrived at the airport and checked in - nothing said about any delays just that a gate hadn't been assigned and to check the board. Went through customs told the flight information on our boarding passes was wrong - incorrect flight number! The board had a gate but no time! We went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45. After what would have been boarding time some Jetstar staff eventually appeared. First we were greeted with - didn't you hear the announcement! Then we were given - reluctantly - $10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed! Then they delayed us as they tried to find 15 missing people - probably the ones who had been told 4.45 instead of 14.45. Never again.,Economy,1,3,1,2,3,2,9,2012,0

Business class seats are quite spacious and comfortable for a single aisle aircraft. The service was impeccable and the food delicious. I really like the WiFi video streaming service so you can watch movies on your laptop or tablet. The movies could be more current but that's a small matter.

The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat.

3401,4575,air-new-zealand,David Killick,New Zealand,"AKL-SIN in P/E. Overnight flight. Air NZ's P/E seats have varied over the past few years depending on aircraft type and routes. These former business-class-style leather seats are extremely comfortable. The only drawback is the footrest which is awkward. Main advantage in P/E is the legroom and space. Our view is that all seats should be like this. Economy cattle class now really is horrible. Air NZ's business class is superb but so much pricier. P/E is well worth the extra cost. If you are hesitating just try it. How nice to have a personal ""Kia ora"" message on your screen. Air NZ's safety video remains hmm quirky though some passengers now find it a little OTT and are fed up with the continued hyping of the Lord of the Rings movies. IFE was only adequate and offerings could have been more comprehensive. Food was excellent. It did seem unnecessary for the FAs to have to make two separate trips to serve up appetizers and main courses when one excursion would have sufficed. Not really a fan of overnight flights if arriving early in the morning (not the case if flying the other direction) as you have to wait hours to get into your hotel. I only doze or sleep an hour or so on flights. We had traveled to Auckland from Christchurch. A direct SQ flight in P/E when/if available (scheduled for September 2015) would be worth considering if you do not need to travel out of Auckland.",Premium Economy,8,4,5,5,4,4,5,2015,1

ET and other reps could not say if planes had landed or not at T1 and was laughed at when asked for help. Flight attendants never address people out of their seats kept shaking me awake on overnight flights for food service even after I put my sleep mask on. Honestly when issues are brought to the attention of an ET rep they genuinely don't seem to care. And they really don't care about competition.

All flight attendants were friendly and provided the best service with the limited product that they could. All flights were on time and there were no baggage issues. No meal on any flight and zero in flight entertainment on any flight. Drinks were served in plastic cups in First Class. The seats were fine but US Airways needs to be put out of their misery. I hope that the merger with American goes ahead and the service on the merged airline is stepped up because right now the domestic/ North American product on US Airways is two-star not three. It is a pastime in Canada to complain about the service on Air Canada.

However when going back home we were notified that our flight was cancelled for unclear reasons that KLM did not want to tell us (we still haven't gott any explanation more than two months later).

Check in was very frustrating as the system would not allow me to check in via phone online or on the mobile app thus I wasn't able to select a seat until I got to the airport. Even arriving 2 hours early reps told me only middle seats were left - trouble for me as I'm a 6'3"" guy. They cheerfully told me I could ""upgrade"" to a Plus middle seat for $42. This didn't seem any bigger or more legroom than normal but at least food (which was tasty) was free. Otherwise trip to YYC was in a clean well maintained B737-700 and crew was friendly. Return check-in online worked fine paid $42 to sit in 1F by the bulkhead as I thought it would be a lot more legroom. My mistake. A horrible seat. Crew on this leg were into making lots of jokes on the PA but when it came to service I found them a bit detached. Overall I took this flight because it was direct to Calgary but at almost $800 all in for the ticket and upgrades I'd hardly call it a low-cost carrier.

The seats were very comfortable and you had a lot of leg room (compared to KLM economy class). The climate onboard was wonderful no dry eyes and it was not too hot or too cold. Most of the time when I get out of the plane after a long haul flight I am absolutely wrecked. The food was not that good I must say but who eats these meals anyway? The flight attendants were very kind although sometimes when I asked for a glass of water he would just forget and I had to go out of my seat to get a glass. I must say they looked understaffed.

The fare was comparable to some of the LCCs yet there's seat selection (even bulkhead seats without extra charges) there's onboard food (even on the 30min DPS-LOP leg) there's a 32kg baggage allowance and both aircraft were new 737-800s with Boeing Sky Interior and PTVs. Singapore T3 departure was seamless with colored stickers indicating boarding order and the flight was smooth including two hot meal choices. Domestic departure from Denpasar was a nightmare though this is mainly the airport's fault and Garuda still made sure to put its customers first.

LOT041 was on the Boeing Dreamliner business class. Boarding in WAW a bit chaotic. Flight left 90 minutes late as workmen attempted to fix (unsuccessfully) a seat that would not go flat. They gave up and said it would be fixed in Toronto. Only about 10 passengers out of 24 seats in the J cabin so it wasn't a problem. Another seat had a tray table that refused to stay horizontal rendering it useless. A metal flap covering the opening of the place where the TV monitor flips up in my seat fell off. All this in a new plane that has only been in service since last December! Cabin service very good FA friendly. Food and drink quite good. The plane itself - the 787 is super-quiet and I love the electronic window shades! A very good experience despite the few glitches.

Food dismal and when I went to the galley to ask for some water I was told ""Wait 10 minutes and we will be round"". But the main issue was safety. No pre take off safety check and on landing 2 emergency exit rows I could see were full of luggage on the floor the occupants on one had ear phones in and their Ipads on window blinds were shut and all this less than 2 metres away from a steward.

The seat itself is roomy and offers excellent privacy and it folds down into a comfortable flat horizontal bed. Unfortunately JAL has a tendency to overheat the cabin which interferes with sleep. On the return trip I solved the over-heating problem by accompanying the purser to the heat control to reduce the heat from the previously set 26 degrees (which is insanely hot). Meals were ok (had the Japanese selection). Champagne was excellent the rest of the wines inferior. Oddly no breakfast available on the overnight flight back to LAX. IFE had an excellent screen and the worst selection of films one could imagine. The flights between NRT and HKG were on a 767 with simply terrible seats.

The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers?

No longer do they allow the usual 1 checked bag free which is the standard on international travel. $25 for my wife's bag and $25 not overweight not oversized just a regular bag. Seems now any checked bag now is charged for shorter international flights. Plus to make matters worse for some bizarre reason Grand Cayman will not let you go through security with a fly rod despite having flown all around the world with one and no problem from any other security. So now this has to be checked which becomes a 2nd checked bag at $40. $40 for a couple 30"" long by 1 1.2"" diameter tubes taped together! At least that one was only on the return leg. I travel a lot and while I cant say I will never fly United again since there are limited options anymore but it will flat out have to be my only option to a place I really want to go to.

Can't expect too much but my wife and I feel short changed. Mad rush through Abu Dhabi airport queues all over the place just made our flight to London. Not enough staff in economy class 2 sometimes 3. Too long to get served. Hot refresher towels 2 hours into the flight. Meals too small in plastic trays. All seemed to be an exercise in cost cutting. Staff very indifferent to service and comfort. Return flight EY32 Paris to Abu Dhabi an hour and a half late leaving.

Even with the added costs of luggage seat purchase etc the airline is still cheaper than others. The older MD 83 aircraft are a cause for concern and I am aware from friends that they have higher than average delay rate. I will still fly them because of price and non-stop service.

However the plane was at least half empty including the seat next to my husband and 2 seats next to me! His actions did not reflect well on the airline which was otherwise very good.

Return flight we we're on an ERJ145 we'd taken off a bit early However while 10 minutes away from Manchester the pilot returned the aircraft to Aberdeen because the aircraft developed a technical fault something to do with de-icing system. We landed at Aberdeen and waiting one hour in the terminal while BMI was finding other arrangements to return the flight to Manchester which I found very quick. BMI found a return aircraft.

2794,3714,air-france,S Varrier,United Kingdom,First and last flight I will take with them. Had flown London-Havana via Amsterdam with no problem with KLM. Return flight with AF - not so. Firstly flight to Paris was cancelled. Received a text about 16 hrs before flight despite them knowing 3 days in advance. Eventually another plane was chartered via Air Caraibes. We ended up leaving 3 hrs later and arriving in CDG after we were originally due to be in London. In Cuba we were told (rudely) we had been booked onto a flight with BA that was leaving at 9pm meaning we arrived in London 9 hrs after we were due to be there with a 7 hr wait in CDG. Told to get boarding pass from AF desk in Paris. Got there to find 4 staff going at snails pace (again rudely) whilst 300 irate and upset passengers waited to get their ongoing passes. We were almost at the front yet waited 70 mins to be told we had to go to the BA desk 2 terminals away. They didn't actually speak to me by the way preferring to speak to my husband. Got to the BA desk who after trying to get a pass for 2 hrs said AF needed to release the booking. My husband ran back and forth between terminals 2a and 2e 3 times before AF would listen to him and eventually conceded that it was their fault. Did we get any apology? No. I will never fly with them again.,Economy,1,2,1,3,3,2,9,2014,0

Had the misfortune to travel on return economy flight to the UK via Dubai on a Qantas ticketed flight the carrier being Emirates. This was my worst air travel decision and flight experience ever in 40 years. The customer focus of cabin staff from the point of boarding to alighting on the two legs outward bound legs of the journey were appalling and I cannot think of anything positive to say. The return journey was only marginally better and the cramped condition of economy seating cleanliness of the plane poor standard of food and inattentive crew made the long haul flight for the most part unbearable. I would usually rate Qantas as an adequate carrier no more no less but it's ticketing partner Emirates will do nothing to improve the perception of Qantas' reputation. If you are looking for a long haul Qantas flight that tickets through Emirates Airline seriously consider using an alternative airline.,Economy,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,2014,0

One flight attendant who did a great job explaining what that meant. Took off right on time and landed in Sydney a few minutes late due bad weather. In flight we were offered tea or coffee and a snack and also water. Return trip was also great with the same seat (6 A) and the service was excellent.

Flight Attendants were very personable and not what I usually get on US Airways. Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight.

Flight operated by Swiss European former Crossair aircraft. Instead of having a hand luggage baggage and a laptop bag decided to have everything in once piece of hand luggage. Resulted in a bit heavier rucksack but compared to other trolleys of other passengers still considerably lighter. (As I assisted fellow passengers placing their luggage). Maitre de Cabin decided that my rucksack had to go into the overhead bin which I agreed to and offered to assist. She declined assistance but when placing it in the bin she screamed down the whole aisle if I was carrying stones in it. Upon take off asked her very politely if that was professional and only got a sarcastic smile and a I dont care body movement. My fellow passengers around me where not amused as well. On top of that she talked about me and my rucksack with her colleague in Swiss German while serving food not considering that I might even speak Swiss German which I do. Snack was a weird cheese in ""curry"" sandwich that was left aside by many passengers. Usually they serve decent sandwiches though. Full bar service. In all slightly delayed but efficient flight.

As a result shopping time in ICN was reduced considerably. As for flight attendants some provided really professional service can speak Japanese Korean and English fluently (same for some pilots inflight). As for the IFE they have a selection of new old Korean Hollywood European films some documentaries and sitcoms. Be cautioned though that selection was the same for the inbound-outbound flight.

I can tell you that the seats have improved but that is about it. The amenities kit is a waste of money. I do use them normally but compared with the past Qantas could save money and not start to replicate the type of services that they use on jet star. I would also suggest they get back to basics with the menu and ditch Neil Perry. The inflight entertainment range is getting smaller and smaller and if you are a regular traveller like me it starts to become tedious. My loyalty to Qantas once rock solid is I'm afraid no longer.

Using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent Dubai to Casablanca flight I was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what I had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like Etihad or Qatar Airways. Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective.

Was my first time flying the A380 despite a few bumps of turbulence near NRT I found it to be an amazingly quiet aircraft. Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6). I would definitely recommend SQ to friends and family; I'm really looking forward to trying out their premium economy service when it rolls out maybe one day the suites!,Economy,8,5,5,5,5,5,6,2015,1

I tried repeatedly to check in online for this flight but always encountered a message that the online facility is only available between 2 and 48 hours prior to departure. Strangely I was attempting to check in 16 hours beforehand. Even mailing the supposed ""online check-in help desk"" was pointless - no reply. When I arrived at CGK I discovered that this flight is operated by Mihin Lanka A320 - quite a step down from UL in terms of standards. There is no IFE on this flight of 4 1/2 hours duration - not even a route map displayed on an overhead screen (although all seat armrests had IFE controls fitted). You cannot lift any armrests so even if you have three seats of a row to yourself there is no way you could lie down across all seats. Catering is basic. A carton of fruit juice or water from the trolley prior to the meal service. The meal tray was about A4 size and was populated by a lone and small aluminium food container with a cardboard lid plus a set of plastic cutlery. Contents: three small morsels of chicken plus rice. Even on my first flight to Sri Lanka on Aeroflot from Karachi in 1980 I was offered more. My attempt to purchase a beer was unsuccessful. Whilst a 330ml can of Heineken (why no Sri Lankan beer) was produced and a price of US$3 charged the crew had absolutely no change for a £5 note. On a positive note the flight was on time.

After the mixed reviews for this airline I accompanied by nine other family members was not looking forward to this flight. Almost a two-hour delay taking off caused by understaffed flight control employees on vacation and a one hour delay landing because of bad weather in Boston tested our grandkids' endurance. But US Airways made the experience on both legs as pleasant as possible. The captain kept us very well-informed and the flight attendants were cheerful and very present. The seats were more comfortable than in many economy cabins I have experienced. Further given the large number of families with young children boarding US Airways was able to start the board process early. Agents at both the check in counter and the gate were exceptionally helpful and friendly. And finally luggage arrived promptly at both destinations.

Started out badly with an apparently brand new ticket counter agent who incorrectly checked me in to ARN not EWR. The lounge at AMS (3rd party) is poor - I hadn't had breakfast thinking I would be able to grab at least some bread/crackers and cheese at the lounge but that was not to be. The lounge does have ample seating but that's about it - no computer terminals. The lounge at CPH was better but not up to the standard of a major carrier's hub (at least not on the first level where Business class passengers are directed) - the only wine (2 choices - red or white) came from beer taps and the food selection was bare bones for an early evening transcontinental departure. Once on board things looked up - with 1 recurring annoying exception - both my seat mate and I both women never got an offer to hang up our jackets and finally wound up hanging them up ourselves - this happens to me a lot and always burns me. Aside from that the service was very good and the food OK - after the meal service when the flight attendants change into chef's outfits they put out a snack bar of fruit cookies etc. and I always like this possibility.,Business Class,7,4,5,4,0,4,6,2013,1

There was no individual entertainment screen for the first leg from Osaka to Guangzhou. I was so bored during the 4 hour flight. The food was incredibly bad. The second leg on a B787 was a little better. B787 is a wonderful aircraft. The plane was clean and new but the seat and legroom was very cramped. The entertainment programs were very poor the sound system sometimes didn't work. Meals were small and still awful. The crew were friendly enough but their English ability was pretty limited.

It's peculiar as a low-cost airline as it offers connecting flights though prices average double compared to the cheapest point to point options.

3906,5278,air-transat,Denis McKee,Canada,Toronto to Faro 11 Feb. Faro to Toronto 26 Mar. Our options were a non-stop flight with Air Transat or a three leg flight (Toronto-Munich-Lisbon-Faro) with Air Canada. Air Transat cost about $300 each more than AC for economy class. Its planes are all more than 20 years old and this route uses the original seating mainly 3-3-3 in a plane designed for 2-4-2. Leg room is less than AC and seat width much tighter. Food was the worst we have had seen since flying American to California. On the return flight the attendants repeatedly walked the aisles imploring passengers to take the inedible mini-pizzas! YYZ-FAO: arrived early and were invited by the friendly agent to switch from row 28 to bulkhead seats! We chose right side which has half curtains rather than a fixed bulkhead and I was able to stretch my legs out in front of me (I'm 183 cm mainly legs) no extra charge! Unfortunately the 3-3-3 seating does not give enough room for the food carts to pass the fixed bulkhead without slamming them repeatedly against it and forcing through an exercise which was repeated throughout the flight and drove our aisle passenger to find another seat after a few episodes. Overhead screen was directly above our heads so we were unable to see anything. Five music channels with volume settings too low to hear or too high to listen bring your own entertainment. Two rear and one mid cabin toilet for about 240 people is way below what is needed on 6-8 hour flights. Cabin crew were efficient but not overly communicative and not very visible after the meal service was over. The flight left about 20 minutes late but arrived almost one hour early so we had to wait for Ryanair to vacate an arrivals slot at FAO. Return flight was almost 2 hours longer in row 26 middle a claustrophobic experience when the seats in front were slammed back for sleeping. The small overhead screens were showing an animated feature to an audience of snowbirds averaging probably 65years old great program planning. Overhead storage is very limited and too many passengers are permitted to bring oversized luggage causing much frustration for later arrivals. Overall these out-dated aircraft need to be replaced with modern equipment for overseas flights but apparently the once a week flights to Portugal have no competitors so Air Transat can charge higher prices for less comfort and an inferior flight experience.,Economy,4,2,3,1,1,2,8,2014,0

On the outbound flight we received just two drinks each before the ""complimentary bar"" was declared closed just a few hours into our ten hour flight. The cabin crew were more interested in discussing what they were going to do in Las Vegas rather than provide any form of customer service and the food was an absolute joke my partner ordered beef stew and received something with three 1.5cm cubes of what I guess was beef and my chicken curry was inedible. The icing on the cake occurred on our return to LGW when we discovered that one of our bags had not been loaded. We did try to complain on numerous occasions and rather than attempt to address any of our issues the cabin crew / Virgin staff simply handed me a piece of paper titled ""Any Concerns?"" - by the end of our holiday we had collected three of these.

However what we experienced was certainly not relaxing or enjoyable. We sat in the middle seats and were extremely uncomfortable because it was very hot in this part of the plane. There was obviously no air conditioning. When we got up to use the bathroom we realized that it wasn't that hot in the other areas of the plane. We traveled during the day and the movies weren't working so we had a 9 hour flight without any access to movies. That made for an extremely long trip especially because it was a daytime flight. To make matters worse my husband was sitting on the aisle seat and the flight attendant ran into him four times with her food cart even through he made it a point to keep his arms and legs out of the aisle. We paid $2100 for our flights to and from Europe. For that amount of money we should not have had these types of happenings.

I didn't feel the need to recline my seat throughout my SIN- SYD trip. There was sufficient legroom and space under the seats to stretch your legs and ample overhead storage space. I didn't miss the entertainment as I brought my own tablet as had most people. That said onboard rental of a fully loaded iPad at $22 seems reasonable to me. While I didn't try all food on offer I did load up on snacks and I like the flexibility of being able to purchase what I wanted when I wanted. The one issue I have is the positioning of the call button on the armrest that often gets accidentally depressed whenever you shift positions in your seat. I'm not a large person but I seemed to set off the pinging each time I shifted. The downside of course is that the stewards/stewardesses may not be as responsive when you actually want to call them.

2088,2839,air-canada-rouge,Caitlin Carrol,Canada,Booked Air Canada Rouge return Ottawa to Las Vegas it was easily the worst airline experience I've had. I was Rouged many times on each flight and don't recommend this company to anyone. Narrow and very uncomfortable seats with little to no leg room (and I'm only 5'5). No inflight entertainment unless you have an ipad or want to rent one from them. Oh and your reward for renting the ipad is a terrible and tiny collection of entertainment choices. Don't forget to charge up your devices because there are no power sources on board. Which makes for a particularly long flight when you're crammed into an uncomfortable seat with no entertainment. Did I mention the food selection? It's not good either. Half and sometimes less than half of what's available on Air Canada flights. I could go on but I won't. It seems like others share my disdain. Don't bother booking premium rouge it's the same seats and same situation as the rest of the plane.,Economy,1,1,2,1,1,1,9,2014,0

Flights originally scheduled to be operated by A330-200 type aircraft. Very long flight on A321 but seat and pitch was comfortable and offered good leg room. Food however in economy was not good and certainly did not match economy meals of other airlines in the Middle East. Crew were pleasant and helpful on both flights. Amman to Colombo on A330.and upgraded to business class. Seats impressive and offered great comfort and easy to sleep in. Food was excellent as was service. I can only echo the same on the Bangkok to Amman flight which again was in business class. My only issue would be the infight entertainment which is very poor as the movie and music channels offer little choice or variety. Amman airport is terrible to transit in. Toilets are dirty and no nice restaurants or comfortable seating. By far the worst airport I have been in transit through.,Economy,7,4,4,3,2,4,10,2012,1
4287,5796,air-transat,K Pruden,Canada,Calgary to London Gatwick and return. Everything was very smooth efficient and pleasant on both fights from check-in to in-flight service and getting our baggage. The flight to London was overnight and there weren't individual screens (3 out of 5 *) but they did play a movie or 2 and a show perhaps on the overhead monitors. I was trying to sleep so I didn't pay attention although I did notice the picture in the screens would jump/flicker regularly. The food was okay for airplane food and they were good with running the drink carts up and down regularly while still allowing quiet time for people to rest. The lighting overhead was really neat since it mimicked sunset and sunrise accordingly. The flight back to Calgary was daytime and there were individual seat back monitors which was awesome. Good selection of free tv shows movies even games and it worked flawlessly (5 out of 5*). I bought the ear buds on board with one of the packages available: the ear buds a snack (chocolate bar) and an alcohol beverage (Baileys) for $9 or $10. You could buy them separately for $3. Lunch wasn't fantastic taste-wise I had the chicken stir fry but it was still a meal and I'm not super picky. I do wish there was a little better selection of snacks - only caramilk or plain pringles but I should've remembered to buy snacks beforehand in the airport and I'm sure they're limited on space. Very friendly attendants on the flight to Calgary. We arrived almost 30 minutes early and it was a nice smooth flight. Baggage was already waiting on the carousel.,Economy,10,4,5,3,4,5,9,2013,1

Three course meal + breakfast. Appetizer (smoked salmon) and desert (cheese plate) were good. Wine selection was solid. Main course was below average. Seats were circa 12 years ago. No AVOD but several channels to choose from. My video worked. My colleague in another row was not so lucky. When she brought this up our flight attendant mentioned how the staff was looking forward to the new A330s. Simple touches would have refined my overall view menu cards a little more attention to make up for the sub-par seats etc but overall it was a good flight.,Business Class,7,3,4,4,2,4,7,2013,1
20988,31688,southwest-airlines,Terry Booth,United States,"On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am.  Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again. ",Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,2015,0

The food service was as good as the other business class flights I take. Others complain about lack of English and flight deck announcements but I did not find either a problem.

He said all those seats had already been purchased. Next hassle while boarding. Swiss doesn't do priority boarding for passengers traveling with babies. The flight crew were very nice and helped to swap my wife's seat with a bassinet seat. I requested the Swiss customer service book a bassinet seat for myself as well however they could only do so for my wife I was told to to contact customer care in Switzerland where I could book a seat next to her at an additional 10% fare.

An example what the staff did for us if that they saw that we traveled with an infant the flight was completely full however the flight attendants get 3 reserved seats at the very back of the plane for them to rest they gave up this entire row so my daughter could sleep laying down on 2 seats and myself beside her.

No hot towels or cold towellettes distributed. Crew were however very pleasant throughout the long nonstop and very obliging with drinks snacks. A snack counter was set up with a limited selection of drinks and eats. Cabin and toilets clean and seat comfort held for the 15 hours just. IFE selection was pretty good too.

18175,27103,precision,P Coker,United Kingdom,I flew from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro then Kilimanjaro to Zanzibar and finally Zanzibar to Nairobi with Precision Air. The aircraft's were acceptable and the air stewards were cordial and polite however the ground handling and check process was terrible. On the outbound flight 2 members of our party were told that the tickets they had were not valid for travel (we all had identical tickets) one of the team was injured on our climb of Kilimanjaro and was transported home early and even though his insurance company and the travel agent had organised the early flight home they attempted to charge him for a new ticket. On our final leg from Zanzibar to Nairobi a different 2 members of the party were told that the tickets they had were not valid and that they needed to purchase new tickets we saw another passenger actually purchase a ticket. We refused to part with any cash and after 3 hours of stress and confusion suddenly the tickets were valid - basically the ground crew were trying to extort money from us and when they realised this was not going to work they gave up.

12618,17858,frontier-airlines,D Woodrum,United States,World Strides trip home from Fort Lauderdale to Dulles International. Flight canceled on 2/21/15 due to weather which is understandable. We were traveling with 32 middle school students and 9 adults. No flight available for 3 days 2/24/15! After a week long event we had students who would need medication before that date (we expressed this to the agent). We had to sleep in the airport that night because there were no hotels available that was not Frontier's fault but having to stay there 2 more nights with 41 people would have been. When discussing flight options with the very nice ticket agent we discovered that not only would we not be able to fly out for 3 days only part of our group could fly out then. Another group would have to fly out on the 4th day and another on the 5th day! This was totally unacceptable. During our lengthy stay in the airport we discovered from other customers (we were camped out right across from the Frontier ticket counter) that almost all customers were delayed the next day (the weather was beautiful) and those who had flown before stated their flights are always delayed (our flight to Orlando was delayed). The lines for check in were crazy long compared to other airlines. People waiting hours to check in. This could have been a marketing dream for Frontier. Imagine the story of helping out a group of stranded middle school students because Frontier cares. Instead they left us stranded for up to 5 days. No refund. No credit. Now 32 parents will never fly Frontier. 9 chaperones will never fly Frontier. For a price gouging company that advertises low prices then charges not only for checked baggage but for carry on bags and charges for water and sodas and basic channel TV I would think Frontier would at least want to retain the customer base they have. I for one will never use Frontier again. The flight attendants and ticket agents are super. The business model is horrendous. They should be ashamed.,Economy,1,2,4,1,1,2,3,2015,0

I booked a flight from Chicago to LAX on United as I was not sure what day I was going to travel. I was informed when I arrived in O'Hare that all flights had been cancelled but flights were being opened up and it looked like all would be well although less than the three hours. I called Fiji Airways to give them a heads up. I was informed it was the weather that caused the problem however then learned it was a fire in one of the main traffic towers. Again I called and informed Fiji Airways what was transpiring and that my flight was getting me in later. Finally we started to board and I called and said that I was going to miss the flight - this was a good 4 hours before FJ811 was due to take off. I was told that the fare was to be $120 for the change plus the change in fare which came to a total of $350. While I was giving my credit card information I was cut off. I immediately called back as I was in line to board and was then informed the fare was now $780. I do not know what sort of scam that was in motion but I am disgusted at the manner that the transaction occurred and feel I should be compensated back to the $350. A change of one day cannot be almost a full fare. I called numerous times to say I was going to be late and was accepting the change in price but to go to double in a matter of 2 minutes is contemptible and it would appear on the surface a way to extract more money due to duress.

My high rating reflects the stellar service and quality of the product in Business class its on a different planet to Economy Class. I snared an exit row seat at a $75 premium on the outward journey. There was plenty of leg room but the width of the seats seems like it is decreasing every time I'm on one of their 777-300's. Luckily I was on good terms with my neighbour. The night time trip down to the toilets is a nightmare having to manoeuvre your way through this obstacle course of legs blankets headphone cables in the aisles. I dread the day when the 747-400s are retired and the 777-300s are the only way to get to the US. Returning home in business class you were in a different world luxury space and privacy is the epitome of what this award winning airline does very well. The only thing that drops this review from a 10 to a 9 was the fiasco at LAX just before the plane departed when the ground crew decided everyone needed to have their cabin baggage weighed. It was a fiasco and yes I agree cabin baggage size and quantity needs to be monitored closely but the manner in which this exercise was performed at the departure gate in particular by one of the two ground staff it really was unprofessional.,Business Class,9,5,5,5,5,4,9,2013,1

Seats were so narrow that the flight was torturous for adults of average size. Attempted to upgrade to Club Class but were told there were only 4 seats available. Once on the plane there were at least 9 empty seats in Club Class. On board service was disorganized and poor. Asked for the baby bassinet 6 times and each time was told ""Sorry I forgot"". We sat in row 4 (directly behind Club Class) and there was absolutely no ventilation or air-conditioning in this section. All passengers in this section were sweating and overheating.

Food from Paris was really good and quite poor from the US to Paris. Decent French wines champagne and Spirits from MSP. Weirdly I was told that they only had wine and port for flights to Montreal. Service from CDG-YUL was a joke not even a drink served until we were over Irish airspace such a disorganized serving of dinner it was laughable. Attendants were stumbling over them selves serving trays and than I just got one passed to me from behind with no words or choices but it was very tasty and the portions were just right. All other requests were self-serving. The 777-300 was horrible no legroom and very cramped A340 old and falling apart but much more comfortable with the exception of the middle 4 seats they were empty but fixed armrests prevented you from getting comfortable and sleeping flat.

4264,5759,airasia,Victor Loukham,India,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one.

In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap?

24473,37682,united-airlines,Paul Hanson,Australia,"Previously we flew United to the US in August 2015 - Sydney to SFO, SFO to LAX, then LVG to Sydney via SFO. No problems, no delays, no cancellations. This past May we flew again to the US with United. I have to admit that this time I was concerned as I had read many bad reviews about the airline. We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX. However that said the pilot was able to make up time in the air and we actually landed early in LAX and easily made our connecting flight to New York. This was the only problem we encountered with United on this trip.",Premium Economy,6,3,4,4,4,4,6,2015,1
6771,9428,biman-bangladesh,Shane Walker,Bangladesh,Due to no seats being available with Singapore Airlines I unfortunately had to fly from Singapore to Dhaka with Biman and so I at least booked Business Class. Flight delayed almost 4 hours without explanation and very little communication from ground crew. Flight crew were reasonably attentive but they really do need to learn to smile. The food was OK but certainly not Business Class standards and they had a very limited selection of drinks and on-board entertainment (not everyone wants to watch Bollywood movies and the screens were too small). The A310 aircraft was reasonably clean but really starting to show it's age. The toilets were a mess by the end of the flight even though it was less than 5 hours duration. Really the only good point was the price i.e. Business Class ticket was half the price of an Economy ticket with Singapore Airlines. I certainly won't be flying Biman again unless I have no other choice.,Business Class,2,3,2,1,1,3,5,2013,0

16185,24173,lufthansa,Tim Rupert,United States,"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.",Premium Economy,5,4,5,3,5,2,7,2015,1

I then discovered that Iberia had refunded my account the fare days after the first payment and Iberia had taken a further amount of double the fare. I have had enormous trouble sorting this out and getting a refund. A call to the same ""helpdesk"" in Madrid resulted in the insisting that the problem was with my (Spanish) bank and that there was nothing further she could (or would) do.

Checked in with no problems but at boarding gate were advised our seats had been re-allocated. We made the point that we had actually pre-booked and paid for the seat allocation and were a bit put out that we had been selected to be moved when in all probability there were other passengers on the flight who had not gone to the trouble of pre-booking seats. Apparently a family wished to be accommodated together. The clerk at the counter gave us our new boarding passes row 88. We said we were happy as long as they were not next to the toilets. We don't make a habit of sitting near toilets in restaurants or airplanes hence the reason we paid the money to pre-book allocation. The clerk checked on his monitor and categorically assured us they were not next to toilets. Having boarded the aircraft we realized we were duped. Row 88 is the farthest row back and is sandwiched between two toilets. Furthermore the seats have limited recline. They are also immediately in front of a bulkhead behind which is situated some form of noisy refrigeration unit for the self service galley area immediately behind us. We were not provided with equivalent seats for which we had paid. More to the point they were arguably the worst seats on the plane. The constant noise from the flushing toilets and refrigeration unit made it impossible to intelligibly listen to any IFE. My partner was very upset at the reallocated seats and credit to the cabin crew they were sympathetic towards our situation and indeed was not their fault. Whilst on the flight we walked through the cabin to check out our pre-booked seats. By no means was it a family with young children in our seats.

Had we known about the lack of free non-alcoholic beverages not being able to recline the seats and being wedged into a seat like a sardine I would have not flown with Spirit Airlines! Luckily our hotel had a working computer and printer for the boarding passes. Otherwise we would have had to pay at the airport for not having boarding tickets. And why did we pay to be in an early boarding group for the entire round-trip if our boarding group and the next boarding group were called to board at the same time? This happened at both legs to our destination and both legs from our destination! Luggage cost: Spirit charges $40 for a 40 lbs suitcase at the time of on-line check-in $50 for additional suitcases. We had three suitcases. Yes it's a bit cheaper if paying for suitcases at the time of reservation which we could not do because we booked through AAA. The cost per suitcase is even more for heavier suitcases and if paid for at the airport. Last I checked most other airlines accept up to 50 lbs per suitcase for about $25. By the way some airlines allow up to 70 lbs per suitcase for international flights. We and several other passengers almost missed the connecting flight from Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore. We flew in from Cancun picked up our luggage to take through customs and then followed the signs to the location for re-checking the luggage. No one was at the re-check location all of us had to go upstairs and re-check our baggage at the regular ticket counter. Having said all this the prices aren't that much cheaper and after all the nickel and diming the cost is nearly the same as other airlines.

18672,27857,qantas-airways,Lacey Heather,Australia,Paris-Dubai on Emirates then Qantas from Dubai to Melbourne. We were simply amazed at how wonderful the Emirates experience was. The Economy class cabin was very well staffed the cabin crew were impeccably dressed and couldn't have been more attentive. We were offered drinks early in the flight and they even had a brandy on offer! On the six hour flight we were asked twice more if we would like another drink. The meal was good for Economy and we got little extras offered like an ice cream. On the Qantas QF10 flight Dubai-Melbourne we had paid the extra for the exit row seats in economy but to our horror we were seated in 48 B and C so were adjacent to the cabin crew's work areas and kitchens. Note to self- don't book these seats again on an A380! While the Qantas cabin crew were very friendly but we were not asked if we would like a drink of any kind until quite a way into the flight and then it was a small glass of cordial out of a jug. Then we were given a beef wrap (not bad) in a box (no tray) which was the last I saw of any service until two hours from Melbourne when I was offered a banana. Mind you I was sleeping for a lot of the flight so it's unfair to criticise as I didn't really need service but what would I have got had I been awake I wonder? The meal offered at the end of the flight looked very poor and I opted for cheese and biscuits. Sadly we concluded that we wouldn't fly Qantas again on a long haul flight if we could get an Emirates option at the same time. Compared to Emirates it would seem that everything about the inflight service on Qantas flights needs a big shake up. Our national airline looks and feels tired and will struggle to compete with the Middle Eastern airlines for much longer.,Economy,4,3,2,1,3,4,1,2015,0

It may just make a huge difference to our travel experiences, on some airlines. I recommend the HKG-ZRH run on Cathay for a good convenient service into Europe.",Business Class,9,4,5,5,5,4,7,2015,1
7035,10006,british-airways,Tarun Thadani,Singapore,Worst customer experience on BA flight. I have a confirmed flights for British Airways from Singapore to Sydney for tomorrow. When I tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online check-in. I called the BA contact center in the UK and was shocked with the response received. The person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating. Essentially BA wants to sell their seats at a premium. They arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesn't mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation. We are travelling as a family but got scattered seats. Very embittered with the overall experience. Will never fly again with British Airways.,Economy,2,1,1,2,2,1,6,2015,0

At Heathrow I asked the check in agent for an empty row in Economy as I had seen there were several. He sort of grunted and sure enough I was sat in a row with another people so moved to an empty row once the doors closed. Not sure what the dish was it was a cold Croatian pastry filled with cheese not really to my taste. Immigration in Zagreb was disorganised with passengers queuing but those with transfer flights moving to the front so it felt like constantly moving backwards. Bags took a long time to come out despite the fact only a few passengers had checked in. Return journey was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to Business Class. Lounge was compact and the food available were peanuts cake and canapé sized bread that was it. The catfish with cold bean salad was again not to my taste. In London immigration was quick but we did have to wait 30 minutes plus for our bags. It will be interesting to see if Croatian improve the offering on this route with a rival airline launching LHR-ZAG flights from December.,Business Class,6,3,3,2,0,5,11,2012,1

Flight late due to late arrival of aircraft - just 30 minutes so no problem. Boarded plane with bus transfer at the aircraft we waited 15 minutes before the door opened then 1 hour on the plane. Crew said that the bags of the arrival flight were still in the plane due to a lack of staff so after that they would load our bags. But we saw the staff sitting on the tarmac. Inflight we were served a snack a bun with cheese or salami with cream cheese spread but we have a lactose intolerance so no food for us. Our travel agent and the booking was informed of that.

11047,15770,emirates,M Morris,Vietnam,I flew Ho Chi Minh City transiting in Dubai to London Heathrow. I usually fly Thai because it's the fastest route by far but the recent political protests in BKK made me think it was probably unwise to transit through Bangkok at the moment. I was deeply disappointed with the seat on the HCMC to Dubai leg of the journey. I was expecting one of those not quite flat angled seat beds but it wasn't even that. The 777-200 on that route is just a reclining seat. Since the flight leaves at 00.40 in the morning I was hoping to get at least some sleep before Dubai. I fly business class to get the sleep. I might as well have flown economy. The food was very mediocre as well. However staff were very nice. The business class lounge in Dubai is excellent. I can't praise it highly enough. The food is great the showers are wonderful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The second leg of the journey was on the A380 the seat was lovely - a fully flat bed in one of those little cubicles. Unfortunately this leg of the trip was during daylight hours so everyone was being very noisy and so despite the bed I couldn't get any sleep and arrived exhausted. The food on this leg of the journey was perfectly okay. The staff were all polite but strangely distracted and not terribly co-ordinated on this leg. The wait between first course and main was about 40 minutes. Very odd. I don't know if anyone from Emirates every reads these things but if they do - could you please put earplugs in the amenity kits? All in all I'd say that although Thai planes are a little older and shabbier the cabin crew are better trained and co-ordinated the food is better the seats may not be totally lie flat but at least you get to lie down on the flights. And most importantly they always give you ear plugs.,Business Class,4,2,5,3,5,3,1,2014,0

We had to spend almost 2 hours on the phone waiting for customer service to book us on a flight the next day which left in the afternoon. Again delayed over an hour and so we lost two days of our vacation. On the way back from Palm Springs we were delayed a couple of hours as well. The line to check in was ridiculous. Every other airline has multiple agents and no line-up.. Allegiant one or two agents and over an hour line-up (both ways). On the way down we were a couple of lbs. over the limit with the check-in luggage and they said no problem.

14761,22033,jetstar-pacific,D Nguyen,Singapore,"When booking a one way flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi I went with JetStar Pacific because I've flown with Jetstar Asia multiple times and had a satisfactory experience and it was slightly cheaper than VietJet. Let's get this straight JetStar Pacific is not JetStar Airlines. It's a partner airline that was given the JetStar name so that they could have domestic flights in Vietnam. In this case JetStar should seriously consider severing ties as this is a determent to their brand. If you check online they have flights from HCM and HAN up to 7 times a day. I thought ""Wow they must be doing brisk business."" I was wrong. One week before I received an email saying that my flight was cancelled and they put us a flight 2 hours before I wanted to depart. I was fine with that even thought we'd have to get up earlier for our 2 hour trek to the airport from the village. But on the way to the airport I get another email saying that our flight was delayed 6 hours. When we arrived they told us it was a ""technical"" issue. We were told that there were no earlier flights. While waiting at the boarding area (they only have 1 dedicated gate) we found that they were boarding a flight for HAN. My mom asked why we weren't put on that flight and they said those customers had been waiting since 6am that morning (5+) hours for their flight. We weren't offered any food or drink. My mom had to ask for food vouchers which provided us with a sandwich. As the time got closer to our supposed time of departure there were no agents at the gate no announcement made of further delays and no further emails. When flight attendants for JetStar showed up for different flight they were immediately accosted by several riled passengers. They were perfectly nice and one attendant looked up on his phone and found that we were delayed another 1 hour (this is not published on their website so it was an internal source). So by the time we boarded the plane it was past 7pm. Let's check the math. By 7pm they managed to get off the ground 2 of the 7 flights they published. Passengers that day had more than a 70% chance of their flight being delayed/cancelled. I have a real suspicion that this was really them trying to get more people on a plane to save costs.

The equipage was different and while the room (premium) was about the same there was no outlet to plug into and the service was much less. As other reviewers have written- the staff spent a majority of their time behind their curtain in the forward cabin. They did their jobs- served towels food and liquor but otherwise you didn't see them very much. The buttons to recline the seat or put up the leg rest were very beaten up (I.e. Old) levers. Some seats worked - mine did not. So I would say your trip is really dictated by: A) the age of the plane and B) the hospitality factor of the attendants. One point in the attendants' favour is that they ran out of chicken on the flt back and switched crew meals to accommodate our choice. Guess Rouge needs more chicken for all the people coming home after a cruise as we start our diets! P.S. I borrowed one of their iPads as my mini kept cutting out on the first flight.

I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option. In addition the friendly and efficient staff the service standards catering in-flight entertainment and onboard comfort on Turkish Airlines (apart from seat pitch) were top notch. The duty free shopping and dining opportunities at IST airport were an added plus. I definitely recommend Turkish Airlines.,Economy,9,3,4,5,4,5,4,2015,1

Connection at DEL was 1.5 hrs which was quite decent timing security again at DEL needs to be streamlined-some customer service skills for the security personnel. DEL/BHX on new Dreamliner seats most comfortable compared to competing airlines. Electronic centrally controlled tinted windows a definite hit in Air India Dreamliners - peaceful sleep food very good but limited drinks in Economy - no wine served.

However we were pleasantly surprised. Staff were friendly and helpful the food was not quite up to LAN standards but more than acceptable and served with some very nice wines. The seats were not quite lie-flat but comfortable enough and we were given nice duvets and pillows. The little flight pack was well put together and useful - especially the warm socks! Business Class lounge in Sao Paolo was OK not great and we gave up trying to connect to the Wifi! It was nice and quiet though. The flight arrived 30mins early in Madrid and the bags arrived quickly.

Their branding is excellent with funny quirky posters and comments throughout KEF airport and onboard however I found there to be very little substance behind this and I certainly wasn't 'wowed'. The crew although professional didn't seem interested in their job and the onboard cafe offering was poor and very limited. I was surprised that a film was shown during the flight however there were no headphones available and I doubt many people carry a pair of two-prong headphones with them. I also found the seats on the surprisingly newish aircraft to be rather old fashioned and uncomfortable for a 3+ hour flight.

2601,3432,air-france,C Chan,Singapore,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,Business Class,1,5,1,4,5,3,5,2015,0

The airport itself was like most no good or bad points. The flights on the other hand were shocking. The outward journey was bearable but only because the plane was only half full. The journey back to the UK was disgusting the staff (all male in economy) were rude and argumentative they ignored us. At meal times I had to ask for our dinner as they passed us by. The toilets were filthy toilet paper all over the floor the floor itself was soaking and not cleaned throughout the journey. The inflight entertainment was poor half the TV's on the seats didn't work if they did the sound was poor. There were no alcoholic drinks allowed on the flight so it was soft drinks tea or coffee.

On the ground its a sad story. City offices in Delhi and Sydney seem to consider customers an unwelcome sight and an insufferable burden. Phone calls go unanswered and the ticketing agent in Sydney had a zonked look on her face and hustled me along. There are others waiting. Rude reservations staff in Sydney. in Delhi the doorman answered the phone after a good 2 minute wait to tell me everyone was out at lunch and I should call later. The call made later were never answered. The next day an over enthusiastic officer who seemed to have been high on something returned my call and was raring to go.

Overall the experience was positive despite the horrible airport in Sao Paulo a facility where there is absolutely nothing to do: just a few shops low quality bars and restaurants and a couple extremely uncomfortable waiting rooms. They are working to expand the terminal so hopefully it will get better soon. In the air everything was okay: A330-200 for the intercontinental leg and A320 for the Asuncion / Santa Cruz one. Good looking and clean planes and pleasant crew even if not super friendly in some cases. The food quality is slightly above average even though they should serve bigger portions. On the minus side I have to mention the entertainment system which should be upgraded as the selection is rather limited and it needed to be rebooted several times during the 12-hour flight from Milan to Sao Paulo. All flights were on time except the GRU-ASU which left one hour late because of a missing passenger whose luggage had to be offloaded (this apparently simple operation seemed to take ages). Will probably choose them again for my trips to South America as they have a good network and a direct flight from my hometown.,Economy,7,3,4,4,2,3,8,2013,1

21647,33496,spirit-airlines,J Leather,United States,"My wife and I have flown Spirit to several destinations over many years. Most recently we traveled to San Francisco via Las Vegas. I wish we could get direct flights to the Bay Area but an overnight stay in Las Vegas is not too hard to take. Our return trip was not so un-troubled. It's true that the current policy of ""your fare entitles you to a seat on the plane - all else is an extra charge"" seems unfair to some travelers but Spirit is up front about it and nobody should feel they were trapped into unexpected charges for e.g. luggage. We travel with one checked bag (just under the 40 lb. limit) and each have a free backpack as carry-on. Those back packs are big enough to hold water bottles snacks a change of clothes in case of ""delayed luggage"" medication toiletries books etc. We only reserve seats together on longer flights and take our chances on the short hops. That saves us $40 on a round-trip. We have never been treated by any Spirit employee in any way but a courteous and helpful manner. I wish I could say the same about major airline personnel. I don't mind paying $8 for a gin and tonic while flying (it's cheaper if my wife joins me). I've paid more than that at airport bars. Our last return trip from Oakland to Philadelphia was our worst experience. We had anticipated about a 7 hour layover in Las Vegas and planned to hop a shuttle to one of the hotels have dinner and maybe spend some time in the casino before getting a shuttle back to the airport. Weather conditions all over the country played havoc with those plans and the schedules of all airlines as well. There were a few passengers embarrassingly stupid enough to take out their frustration caused by the weather on the crew. We arrived at Las Vegas with just about enough time to check in for the LAS to PHL flight. Since I could not book the trip as a fight from OAK to PHL changing planes in LAS I had to book it as two separate flights. I doubt if Spirit or any airline would take responsibility for us if we missed our flight from LAS to PHL since they did not schedule it as a connection they planned for our journey. If we missed the plane we had designated as a ""connection"" the fault would be ours. That's something to keep in mind if you are planning a trip on Spirit or any airline that uses a lot of ""hub and spokes"" in designing their routes. Overall we have been pleased with the service and prices that Spirit offers the public. The ""hardships"" we have had to endure have been minor and well worth the savings. I hope to start planning our next trip very soon.",Economy,9,3,4,4,0,5,7,2014,1

1845,2584,air-canada-rouge,Clarence Byrd,Canada,On boarding a flight from Tampa I was shocked to find that what this airline calls business class consists of placing you in an economy sized seat with standard leg room. The only extra feature was that an empty seat was left between A and C. I fly business class largely to acquire a larger and more comfortable seat. With Rouge you pay for business class seats but you do not get them. Further you are not warned of this when you book your flight. The information provided indicates no difference between Rouge business class seats and regular business class seats. This is a deceptive practice and Air Canada should be required to post proper information on this matter. In any case I will never consider using Rouge again.,Premium Economy,1,1,4,3,2,1,10,2014,0

From the beginning there was a noticeable lack of service at the airport a very casual approach to almost being a big yawn. We boarded a very crowded old Boeing 757 it was scruffy dirty and the flight crew even scruffier. We had paid for Economy Plus and a bulkhead all added extra's happy to pay when the service is provided in this case the seats were so narrow it was hideous the galley to our right was occupied most of time by a flight attendant who was more interested in himself than anything else the rest of the crew appeared very uninterested even the First Class crew could not smile. The continual line for the restrooms required us to keep moving our legs never again. We were showered in ice cubes from the galley twice I ordered a cocktail to help keep me calm $14 AUD for a drink such a rip off it was basically thrown at me. What has happened to United? We vowed never to fly with them again now here comes the kicker we had a return from LAX-HNL in late May a 777-200 lovely aircraft two roomy seats on the side in Economy Plus and some of the most charming flight crew I have met. I talking an older crew they offered superb service with a smile I told them they had restored my faith in United for which I received great thanks and was told they were called the originals.

On the return leg the flight wasn't very full and the cabin crew encouraged people to spread out and find a row for themselves once airborne (we had to stay in our allocated seats for take off due to weight distribution).

Cabin crew are variable but mostly good I suspect the multinational nature of crews contributes to this variability. The connection time in Dubai for the outward leg was 90 mins but there was someone at the gate who met me and other transfer passengers with shorter connections and escorted us to transfer buses. On most legs the food was reasonable (except for the hot meal from Auckland which was nearly cold by the time I got it) though the decisions about when and what to serve seem bizarre. For example the flight leaving at 7:30am served lunch 2 hours into flight and on the return I got two evening meals served 3 hours apart. Unlike KLM/AF who I've flown with lots in last 5 years there is not a self service buffet mid flight on the long haul legs.

I paid 4 dollars for a water at the airport and 12 dollars for a cheeseburger so I didn't find the price for a beverage crazy as most but reasonable! If you don't want to pay baggage fees carry a backpack it is free! We went from Baltimore to Las Vegas and found the flight pleasant.

9774,13656,delta-air-lines,A Bastien,United States,5/4/15 SMF-MSP Airbus A320 Economy Comfort legroom adequate service competent. Complaint: Delta does not post economy comfort fares on its website but as separate upgrades for each flight segment. Value for money rated at 1 because I traveled on an award ticket entertainment rated as 1 because the flight didn't have any. Legroom was slightly better than on previous Economy Comfort flights but recline was still minimal. Food for purchase was unappealing but the complimentary snacks and beverages were acceptable. I wouldn't recommend Delta because it seems to focus more on nickel and diming its passengers than in providing quality service.,Economy,6,3,3,3,1,1,5,2015,0
11461,16267,etihad-airways,Matthew McGrath,United Kingdom,LHR-AUH-SYD return. Just returned from a trip to Australia. The chauffeur pick up worked well and the lounge at T4 was very good. Staff very attentive. On A340 on both outbound legs and food and wine of good quality. On the way out visited the crowded lounge in Abu Dhabi but managed to have a shower and the staff helped find me a place to sit. Inbound first leg on code share Virgin Australia. Etihad seats far superior as every seat has an aisle access. On the Virgin flight (777) I had a window seat and had to climb over the passenger next to me when he was sleeping. Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one. Food and wine again good on return legs. My only criticism is that the entertainment on offer is nowhere near what it is on Emirates or Qantas.,Business Class,9,5,5,4,3,5,9,2014,1
7048,10020,brussels-airlines,I Ursu,Luxembourg,We flew the LIS-BRU flight leg thinking it would be a TAP flight. Unfortunately we got to experience the true horror of flying low-cost and paying normal carrier prices. No free food or drinks included. The seat must have been the worst seat I had ever sat on during a flight. Like somebody else said an iron board with a leather cover. They revisited the concept of a head rest and installed instead a flat rock to rest your head on. I guess the hard plastic of the front seat in my knees came should not have been a surprise after this. In BRU airport we were taken to the non-Schengen terminal and then with a bus to the luggage terminal. Outside through rain and snow. Overall one of the worst and deceiving flight experiences.,Economy,5,1,2,0,1,1,1,2015,0

Thick mattress and decent size pillow allowed 7 hours sleep which is the most I've ever had flying from Europe to Asia. Lots of storage room for glasses book iPad if you have the aisle seat. Huge TV screen and good selection of latest movies. Staff were really nice and friendly and seemed to care that the whole flight was enjoyable!

8090,11297,cathay-pacific-airways,A Moreitz,Australia,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.,Economy,7,5,4,3,4,4,12,2014,1

After that a decent dinner of two choices with wine and what you want. Including brandy with the coffee. Meal/snacks or breakfast before landing according if it is a day or night flight. Between meal services all liquor is free of charge in Economy Extra. I prefer to walk to the galley to get some exercise and wine but if you go there and don't order in your seat make it clear if the FA has not seen you before that your are in Extra. What is most important in Economy Extra is the comfort. I can even take a nap or sleep in these seats compare to normal economy seats. Okay VOD system. Some people have claimed that you have to pay for liqour outside dinner time and that the seats are the same as in Economy.

The cabin was spotless on outbound flight and considering cleaners do not come on aboard at SZG the return cabin was also very clean. The seat pitch and width was comfortable for a short haul flight although the seats do not recline however for the length of this flight it was not needed. The redesigned overhead luggage bins permit a large amount of bags bulky coats etc to be stored without jamming them in and the locking mechanism appears to be a lot more secure than in the older 737s. The cabin crew on both flights were not only very efficient but friendly too. Outward flight took off on time and with a strong tail wind arrived in SZG 1hr 15mins later. The return flight was delayed slightly but that was due to the aircraft needing de-icing so no complaints there as I would rather fly on a safe aircraft than risk icing of the wing flaps! There were a selection of snacks (incl hot paninis that could be purchased - I didn't) but their special offer on bar drinks was reasonably priced. Charter flights used to have the reputation of treating their passengers like cattle but certainly on this flight Thomson were just as good as any scheduled carrier and compared to some ""cheap airlines"" a lot better.

421,555,aegean-airlines,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.,Economy,6,4,3,4,0,2,9,2012,1

AC792 arrives late from LAX into YYZ but still there is an hour to connect to AC271 YYZ-YWG. Canada Customs press a magic button which allow my 2 checked bags to go directly to my connecting flight when I announce I am returning from a vacation in Hawaii. I proceed to my domestic gate to board AC271 and while in line am redirected by the gate agent to see her colleague at the gate desk. I am told I have been taken off the flight as my 2 checked bags won't make the flight? I am offered a Y class seat on the last flight of the night with a suggestion by the gate agent that the stars may align and I may get to ride in the cabin I paid for. Sent unceremoniously to the Maple Leaf lounge to await my fate I am granted access to the exclusive club even though I have now been stripped of my upper class status. Within an hour I am presented with a J class boarding pass for the last flight of the night to YWG. Was I bamboozled by my favourite mother country flag carrier giving away my original highly prized seat 1A on a Jungle jet back to Winnipeg on AC271? My 2 checked bags went through YYZ without me even seeing them and they were secured for travel from LAX-YYZ-YWG on company aircraft yet I was denied boarding AC271 based on the fact that my bags would not make the flight? Was I being punished for flying Delta from HNL-LAX in order to avoid flying Rouge? Or was my seat given away prematurely to a company commuter?

As a LCC Air Arabia offers free carry on luggage and additional checked baggage for SR 50. Also offered confirmed seat for SR 50. I took the seat confirmation on both legs. Did not take advantage of the advance purchase meal offer nor did I purchase anything to eat on the flights. Inflight entertainment on A320 was suitable for a short haul flight. Seats were comfortable and flight attendants professional and efficient. On board sky sales were relatively affordable but I did not notice any major brand names. Interesting boarding and seating announcements were started while passengers were boarding rather than after the doors had closed. I thought this was a good use of crew time.

The biggest problem is the IFE. During my flight the IFE was not working the movie would break in the middle of the show and during some of the time the voice would disappear. Even with twice re-booting the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for.

On flights between DOH and LHR (on A340-600) and FCO-DOH (on A330-300) there was a problem with the air conditioning at DOH so it was like an oven until the flight took off to LHR. In FCO the flight was parked in the middle of nowhere so the boarding experience was terrible. IFE was a shocker - no touchscreens and an inspiring collection of movies and shows.

When we finally realized it, the plane was pulling away from the gate.  No announcement or email message (but they can bombard me with ads on my email account).  Next plane was nine hours later (overnight).  And to add insult to injury, charged us a $75 per person change fee.  No offer to food or hotel or alternate airline.  Just tough luck.

Allegiant is simply unable to accommodate delays (weather/mechanical) flight crew timing out or what have you.

Only after I really got angry - and walked off the plane - telling them to get my luggage off - a steward from the front end of the plane got involved and shuffled people around so we could sit together. Our friendly stewardess then managed to ignore us for the whole trip. Second leg - we were on the last row of an ancient DC9 - with the galley next to us and a toilet door that would not close properly.

26244,39711,vietnam-airlines,S May,Australia,"Myself and my wife have travelled extensively throughout Asia and Europe. We are halfway through a 2 week Business class trip to numerous destinations in Vietnam. We were booked to travel to Danang from Hanoi yesterday. Due to a typhoon flights were delayed. NO-one at Vietnam airlines would advise us if they would be rescheduling flights. No communication to passengers no notices. Nothing to let us know what was happening. We waited for 6 hours at the airport. We after repeated requests were rescheduled to first available flight the next day 30 hours after our flight was postponed. We left the airport to get a hotel room for the night at 8.40pm. Friends of ours who could not afford to stay in a hotel decided to stay at the airport. They were put on an ""unscheduled flight"" 20 mins after we left the airport. We are extremely upset with Vietnam Airlines They told us that no flights would be leaving until after 2am and that we had to rebook with first available seats (business or coach) which were 9pm the following night. How can it be that we are told there is no seats and no flights yet our friends (coach travellers) are at the destination and we are still sitting here waiting for ""the only flight available""? Vietnam airlines seriously lack communication skills integrity and respect to the passengers. I would advise anyone wishing to travel with Vietnam Airlines to seriously think about another airline.

Virgin Atlantic offers the best pre-flight and post-flight service in the business; excellent food attentive staff both in the Heathrow Clubhouse as well as their Boston Logan lounge and the Revivals Lounge at Heathrow. Cabin staff are very attentive too although a bit slow. On-board food is mediocre; eat on the ground if you have the time. The problem are Virgin's Upper Class seats. I'm slender and not too tall and even I had a very hard time being comfortable in them.

I purposely selected seats in the small economy cabin right behind PE thinking this would be a better experience. Straight away I noticed my IFE screen wasn't working. Brought this to the attention of first available flight attendant she told me there were plenty spare seats in rear of cabin if we wanted to move. We packed up our stuff and went back 10 rows and settled in again. Now I couldn't select any movie! Again I struggled to get an attendants attention when I did he in fairness told me that ""they were sick of the IFE's breaking down"" I was given a tablet so at least I got to watch a few movies. The meal was edible by airline standards which isn't saying a whole lot. My biggest problem with the whole flight was the general total air of non interest from the cabin crew!

On A330 I would advise taking the $75 upgrade to a bulkhead seat - particularly row 11 as its right behind Business class and in a mini cabin of only 3 rows. If travelling overnight I'd pay for economy and upgrade on check-in online to Business if available. Best thing about the flights was the excellent service and the prompt appearance of baggage at the carousel. Food was good drinks plentiful. Pay TV option was a bit much but we read. I joined their FF program before I booked - for only $120 it was worth it! Business check-in express pass through customs lounge access it's kind of like the Qantas Club.

A good initiative from Qantas an extra section for each meal not available on board. Beverages are excellent and the option of freshly toasted sandwiches on demand.

The second flight was an hour delayed just boarding - no announcements were made for the reason of the delay. Once we boarded we waited another hour and a half on the plane. Again no announcements were made as to why we were waiting for at least the first hour and no crew were in sight we just sat there. Food was pretty mediocre and when offered a choice of chicken or seafood they then said there was no chicken and I had to wait. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring the food out after serving everyone else and when I asked for it after about ten minutes the crew member just laughed and said you will have to wait.

Very good is also the car shuttle to the gate. Flight: Very old layout of cabin seats are very old and dated without any touch of luxury. There is very limited privacy between the seats. The TV screen is very small. The seat adjustment panel shows its age some buttons do not work properly. The toilets have also absolutely no luxury features they look more like economy than first class very limited amenities (only one hand lotion and one face lotion but no lip balm no mouth wash etc.) after some hours they are out of tissues so you have to use paper tissues - very economy style! Amenities OK but again no luxury. The pyjamas are good quality. Food is OK but not on First standard (same choice and quality as Business Class). Limited choice. The chicken had absolutely no taste the rice also tasteless - overall really not good. Good is the quality of the wines. During the flight there is no food available - worse than in Business Class where they serve sandwiches etc. Service very disappointing: 3 empty water bottles remained for more than 5 hours beside me. The maitre de cabin however was nice and tried to accommodate us as much as possible. Overall very disappointing far away from Premium airlines like Emirates Etihad and Singapore Airlines.

Spirit doesn't charge for Personal bags (smaller than a carry-on) and you can get more than enough in a personal bag. The night before our flight we picked our seats online and check 1 large bag for 3 of us. The people who show up at the airport unprepared should only be angry at themselves.

This happens with Easyjet as well as Monarch in my experience. Flight out only two-thirds full and a good service. Return was full and the usual mayhem for those boarding later who had nowhere to put hand luggage - it eventually being taken off to go in the hold (""the hat bins are now full"" as the flight attendant quaintly put it).

In both directions the cabin crew were excellent and that is where all good about Rouge stops because no matter what these great people do they can not solve issue with lack of space between the seats. Airplane type was A319 and they had 31 raw of seats which basically means no leg room at all. Anyone close or above to 6 feet or 180cm should avoid Rouge flights. Seating pitch on this plane is 29 and this is for flights to Caribbean. After 3.5 hours of flight you will not be able to get out from your seat because of pain in your back and legs. It is so tight between the seats that in my view this is security issue since in case of the emergency people will have extreme difficulties to quickly leave the seat. When it comes to entertainment system there is something called wifi and that has to be paid 10 $ but it did not work so I can say is it worth or not other than this there is no other option. When it comes to food and drinks non alcoholic beverages including coffee and tea are free how ever quantity is limited to one or if you are lucky two drinks at the best.

1798,2537,air-canada,Gordon Nettleton,Canada,"This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the ""pods"" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities.

Basically they got us to Italy and back. But it was just an awful experience all around.,Economy,2,1,2,1,2,2,11,2012,0
15736,23370,korean-air,D Naylor,Australia,"ICN-HKG KE613 A330-300 Business class. Having experienced a very poor flight with Korean a few days earlier I hoped that the longer sector would enable KE to lift their business class service. It was better in this 3 hour flight but well below other regional airlines charging similar fares. The 330 was relatively new and the pod seats set in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats seem the same as the 747-400 and appear quite acceptable. Pre takeoff soft drinks only followed more quickly this time by hot towels after takeoff. The crew again were polite and courteous in greeting and approaching you as a valued passenger. When asked for our pre-lunch drinks and eating choices the Champagne listed on the wine list was ""not carried on this flight"". Hardly a ""normal"" business class. Wines were served from a bottle this time and there was a choice of white and red and spirits if required. Inflight entertainment was broad and acceptable. However this flight proved to my satisfaction after my earlier shorted flight that KE is at best a 3 star airline in its business class and that unless its fares are lower I would chose a different carrier. 2 years ago on an Asiana flight from Shanghai to Taipei the latter's standard were far superior.",Business Class,5,4,3,3,4,3,5,2013,0

Hardware-wise, I think everything was great. The food was good, seats were comfortable, and the plane was clean. The IFE could be improved further though. Service-wise, I would say Thai Airways is inconsistent. On all the four legs flown, I saw cabin crew from the the super helpful and friendly to rude and unfriendly.

Both flights were delayed by 15 mins on take off but made up the time in the air. The seats were slightly on the smaller side and slightly less leg room than other major airlines but I am not too tall and the flights were short so it wasn't a problem. There are drop down TV screens which showed live flight path speed altitude etc. The Pegasus planes were more modern than the Jet2 planes that we flew from Newcastle to Dalaman. The flights themselves were comfortable (not much turbulence). I had no problems with collecting my luggage. Overall I would highly recommend Pegasus.

We paid extra to have some leg room and with this selection by the exit door baggage must be stored overhead. We have been in these several times and are aware of this. To the point the flight attendants on this flight need a lesson in customer service. While trying to put our luggage up we were told to stop sit down and wait not because we were interfering with the aisle or movement she just didn't want us doing it. Along with this when we asked about the movie playing in English and French at the same time we were ignored. While collecting the waste from the food trays once again we were in trouble. Apparently collecting your trays together so you still have room is a big no no? Trust me they will let you know you are the stupidest person on the plane. I was embarrassed.

Such an amazing modern plane and they give you just two movies for free for 10 hour flight and want you to buy the others I have never seen this anywhere else.

11663,16495,etihad-airways,Colin Dale,United Kingdom,I was scheduled to fly from BKK through AUH to LHR. Etihad run a 'tight' connection at AUH and on this last trip the whole process was a shambles. Their flight into BKK was very late and Etihad suggested that we would not make the AUH connection to LHR. I spent a lot of time (and money) on calls trying to resolve commitments in the UK accordingly. In the end rather than pay for accommodation and similar for (I estimate) 100 passengers they simply made the AUH flight wait two hours and thus inconvenienced over 300 passengers! Investigating their schedules and the way they handle their aircraft (in this case A6ETB) it was clear that they had elected to deliberately run this aircraft late for three consecutive days. When I say late I mean hours not minutes: you can imagine the difficulties that passengers face arriving at LHR and getting out around 10 pm at night rather than at 7 pm. I would and urge everyone who is considering using Etihad to be quite careful they may have an equipment shortage or simply be electing to mess people around as they know that there is limited legislation for a non-EU airline of this nature.,Economy,1,2,1,2,3,1,4,2014,0

The chauffeur service arrived promptly at my home and as always was immaculately turned out. Our drive to Manchester was made tedious by heavy Friday traffic but the driver handled everything calmly and with good humour. At the terminal I was checked in swiftly and 20 minutes later was in the Emirates lounge (this included time spent picking up some last-minute purchases). Boarding was on time and the flight left slightly early. After watching a film and enjoying supper I got 4 hours solid sleep waking up about 50 minutes out of Dubai. We landed a few minutes early and it took only 20 minutes including the security check to get to the gate for my connecting flight despite this leaving from Concourse C and the arrival having parked right at the end of Concourse B. The flight to Muscat had particularly personable cabin crew; we were on time and for a change I even had a light breakfast on this 40-minute hop rather than falling asleep! In all a perfect trip: no fuss no worries.

Staff were great pleasant and courteous and it was always service with a smile. They weren't around much after the meal service but did respond to calls. Personally I do not think these seats are great value for money due to the inadequate meal service and the general similar cramped feeling of economy.

It was a brand-new Airbus with individual seat- back televisions and a range of good movies with subtitles pleasant smiling courteous flight attendants a regular supply of water periodic meals that were of average airline quality best of all a comfortable economy- class seat with decent legroom. After the Shanghai layover of several hours the flight to HK was exactly like WestJet or Air Canada: on-time followed by brisk friendly in-flight service of complimentary refreshments. My luggage arrived in HK promptly. My ongoing flight to Paris several weeks later was a true test of an airline’s customer service. I had severely sprained my ankle in HK mere hours before the flight. At HK airport China Easterns check-in crew volunteered a wheelchair before I even asked then short-cut me through immigration and security and wheeled me directly to the boarding gate even offering to help me shop at duty-free en route. During the flight to Shanghai an attentive attendant asked if I wanted a wheelchair waiting for me there. Again I was pushed in a wheelchair through immigration and security to my Paris flight which had all the creature comforts of the outbound one from Vancouver plus the flight attendant found some Ibuprofen for me. She also arranged for a wheelchair to take me through the labyrinthine Paris airport through customs right to the taxi queue. China Eastern has my gratitude and vote of approval.

The fact that the plane was less than half full helped as you could get a row of seats to lie down and the staff were relaxed about you moving seats unlike some airlines that tell you they cannot take off until you have returned to your seat. Staff were attentive enough but as soon as their duty was done they disappeared to rest. Some were friendly and helpful but most are perfunctory and a little disinterested.

The flight to HK on 330 was very comfortable with excellent food and service. The inflight entertainment was good with a wide variety. I slept a little enjoying the flat bed. The flight to CDG later in the evening was in the small front business cabin. I wanted to try this because everyone raves about the cosier and more private space. I was in 11K. Small cupboards are located right here as well and these were accessed a lot by FA which was distracting and did wake me up several times. Also after dinner was served it is a long wait to breakfast. My only complaint is that the flat bed is much firmer than the 330 and in fact uncomfortable and difficult to sleep on at times. On the return flight from CDG-LHR I was in the main business cabin this time which was in fact quieter. The FAs did disappear for sometime and often were engaging in conversations in the galley and less interested in checking on PAX during the flight. When I requested a snack because it was way past dinner time in terms of Paris time the FA was at first a little put out by my request (a first in my experience flying CX). I also found the inflight entertainment almost identical on all flights and hence found it difficult to find anything to watch. Admittedly it was return flight in one week. The flight from HKG-SYD was very good with probably better service than the Paris legs. The food was good although the dinner was served only half way through the flight and then nothing for the last four-five hours. All flights were punctual and even early at times. It is a good value for money business class ticket especially as their business class is one of the best overall.

The ICE entertainment was superb the staff were friendly and the catering was above average. What I disliked the most was the boarding 'process' they had to make it sound 'so grand'. I sat at the front and by the time I boarded and requested for eyeshades they were gone already. Also it is very hard to hear what the guy was saying as there were a battle of voices between our flight and the Qantas flight at the next gate. The queues for transfer were very long in Dubai but it was pretty inefficient. However it takes 40 minutes to get from the first gate to the second although at a leisurely pace. The second flight from DXB-HKG was far more horrible. We had to endure the horrendous 3-4-3 configuration. The ICE entertainment on the 777-300 was not as modern as the A380 thus the person behind me had to press the screen with tremendous force every time to get his TV working. The screens were also far smaller and much harder to operate. But in terms of service it was really average.

It was late we taxied out on the runway and then stopped. It took the pilot 2 hours to tell us that we had mechanical difficulties. At 8 pm we were told that the plane could not take off. We were herded off the plane told to reclaim our luggage and told we would be put up at a hotel. Ushered to the sidewalk outside Bradley International Terminal to await a bus. For 90 minutes we were shuttled back and forth from one side of the sidewalk to the other. The Alitalia representatives were useless. We finally got on a bus to a Marriott Hotel we got there at 9.45 pm only to be told that there was no room at the inn and we now had to go to another Marriot. At 11 pm we arrived at the next hotel. The bus picked us up the next morning for our reschedule 11 am flight which of course was late. The plane was straightened out but the food sitting in their kitchen overnight was congealed. The crew were indifferent. We arrived in Rome at 8.15 am local time. Now if you have a plane-load of people delayed by almost a day many of whom have connecting flights wouldn't you think the airline would have spent some time going through the passenger list to make sure they would be rebooked onto other flights? We got off the plane only to find out that we had to reclaim our luggage once again. We were escorted to the ticket counter and left to fend for ourselves. It took us hours to book our connecting flight to Istanbul. As we made our way through the airport which by the way has no people movers or luggage carts we kept running into fellow passengers. Absolutely no help from Alitalia. We boarded a bus that would take us to our plane it was easily in the 90s outside and the bus had the heat blasting. No one from Alitalia noticed.

25778,39229,virgin-atlantic-airways,J Warren,United Kingdom,"LGW-CUN-LGW. Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Economy,7,4,5,3,3,4,7,2015,1

The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa.

21714,33809,sunwing-airlines,K Brooks,Canada,We travelled SunWing for the first time on April 27th to Cuba. We decided to upgrade to the 'Elite' service as it was our honeymoon. We were completely disappointed by Sunwing and the staff at Pearson. Started off with the 'priority' baggage handling. Told that they could check our bags starting at 12.45 so we got in line at that time. Got to the counter at 12.50 but was told they were still checking late bags from the previous flight and asked to stand to the side of the line until those were done. As we stood there waiting they started letting people from our flight on. We approached the baggage lady and were told we had to go back and stand in line again (which was now a huge line up). A few hours later we found ourselves waiting for the 'priority' boarding service. They called this so we went to the line and found about 60 people ahead of us. We assumed they were all flying elite but 30 seconds after the announcement for priority boarding they started boarding everyone else. The wife and I went to the desk and asked if we were still getting boarded first. The woman working at the desk said we were and said to give our ticket to the woman checking boarding passes who just stood there and intentionally ignored us while continuing to check other peoples passes. This went on for about 5 or 6 passengers until I asked her if she was going to take our boarding passes which I slid across the desk when her partner asked us to. I picked up the boarding passes and held them directly in her face as I guess she was expecting me to do. Once landed in Cuba our 'Elite' seats were in the middle of the plane (which they off loaded from both front and back) so we ended up being last off the plane. After clearing customs from the back of the line we found our bags just sitting alone in the airport. Landing back in Canada our bags were not brought off first as they were supposed to. The only bright notes was from the Cuban Airport staff. They actually did allow us priority boarding from Cuba. We will likely not ever fly Sunwing again and for sure not waste money on their 'Elite' service.,Premium Economy,6,1,1,3,2,1,5,2015,0

To be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. Flew back to Tokyo on Air NZ a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference.

Food was terrible condition of plane was poor and customer service let's see was non existent. As many others have commented they serve drinks then dinner and then they disappear for 5.5 hours. Even if someone pushes the bell for service they just ignore it. Unbelievable. Waited 2 hours to get our luggage in Toronto because they needed to search the luggage before they released it.

3504,4737,air-new-zealand,V Hunter,New Zealand,We booked an infant fare with Air NZ for a flight from Auckland to London and had to pay an extra $100 each leg to access a bassinet seat. The infant fare also doesn't include checked luggage which meant we had to spend another $155 each leg for 23kgs of luggage. Compare this to Qantas where both the 'extras' of the bassinet seat and 23kgs luggage were included as part of the fare. Overall we had to spend $255 extra on each leg for an infant to travel on top of a relatively high base fare. When I discussed this with AirNZ customer service they indicated the cabin luggage limit of 7kgs should be perfectly fine for travelling long haul with an infant obviously never travelled with a child. Very disappointed with Air NZ's approach to infant travel as well as the response of the customer service representative.,Economy,1,3,4,3,3,2,11,2014,0
26367,39874,virgin-atlantic-airways,A Hallatt,United Kingdom,"09/09/14 VS016 from MCO 19.35 (Delayed until 21.20). I have flown with Virgin a few times and they usually a good airline to fly with (and I have written positive comments accordingly) but this last flight the attendants were completely disinterested in their customers. Such a shame to see how much the staff on this particular flight have let their company down. We were sat in the emergency exit seats and a staff member seemed more interested in using the exit door as a ""beat box"" with his hands and yawning without having the courtesy of at least putting his hand over his mouth. Our friends on the other side of the plane were served with the same amount of interest. Come on Virgin Atlantic where is the professionalism?",Economy,6,2,1,2,5,2,9,2014,0
9737,13529,copa-airlines,A McCullough,Canada,Flew Toronto to Panama City Direct got a great seat-sale. Did the web check-in for way down got row 11 and when you do the web check-in for the first leg it automatically did the web-check in for our return flight but somehow we got row 30 not sure how that happens? We checked in at Panama City and were able to get row 32 (only row where a seat hadn't been booked). Agent gave us aisle and window and nobody booked middle seat so we got lucky and had all 3 seats to ourselves. Service on way down was outstanding but I think they were short-staffed on way back because service was slow and they ran out of chicken meals (to be expected I guess when you're at the back of the bus). Blankets pillows drinks meals and headphones were all provided without extra cost. Would definitely fly Copa again.,Economy,7,4,4,5,3,5,11,2012,1

23512,36232,thai-airways,V Blaxell,Australia,MEL-BKK. More comfortable than economy but otherwise this version of Thai's business class product is at best not quite up to par and at worst very poor. On this 777-200 the pod style seats looked plastic and worn out with obvious signs of age and wear. Seat control module was not always responsive upholstery was exceptionally hard. Slightly angled full recline was not a major issue for me but the short footrest area was as my feet dangled over the end and dragged me ever closer to the floor. IFE is unexceptional and the screen and controls very old fashioned. Food was much lower in standard than economy food on SQ MH or CX. FAs tended toward the sullen some with very poor English indeed. Nevertheless they were attentive throughout the flight. The whole experience was mediocre. It's a long flight and a busy route for Thai and they might think about treating their Australian customers better.,Business Class,6,2,3,1,3,1,5,2013,0

Seats seemed small even on A380. Biggest gripe was that it was freezing - on all legs. I did ask why it was so cold and was told I could have an extra blanket. Staff were ok nothing remarkable. No eye shades and I was so sore because of the seats. Entertainment was average. Food ok.

We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth.

7360,10397,british-airways,V Pervaaz,United States,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs.

Served a very good champagne before take off. I was disappointed by the catering in first class from JNB wines were very good but food is far from standards in first class.

All flights on time or early service in the air generally fine with FAs ranging from just pleasant to attentive and good. While service as such was ok for economy standards there is a distinct decline of service quality noticeable over the years also with JJ in addition it seems the take-over from LAN did not really help. Seats on the international sectors were significantly more comfortable than the ones on the domestic legs where JJ uses the uncomfortable Recaro slim seats however as leg room was ok it was fine for the short domestic sections. On the morning GRU-MVD flight a tasty muffin on the afternoon return flight MVD-GRU an inedible cheese and ham sandwich was served no food on the domestic segments just a small pack of salty snacks one drink round on all legs (including beer) but additional drinks were served on request with a smile. Web check-in went smooth with no or short lines at the premium check-in counters all check-in staff very friendly except for GRU where the agent seemed just tremendously annoyed didn't say a word after the initial contact and was more interested in chewing her gum than dealing with us. The main negative event of the flights was the transfer in GRU on our way from MVD to FLN. While the flight into GRU was 20 minutes early and border control was efficient and fast it took 70 minutes for the luggage to arrive which has to be picked up in GRU and rechecked after customs (same as in the US or Canada). Priority bags were out last. Also JJ uses T3 for international and T2 for domestic flights with no direct shuttles between those terminals. The shuttle goes from T3 to T4 to T1 and finally to T2. So after a 15 minutes wait for the shuttle it took us a further 30 minutes to arrive at T2. Although we had a connection time of more than 2 hours and were 20 minutes early into GRU we barely made our connection flight. In general ground service from JJ at GRU was abysmal. As for lounges we only used the one in MVD which was elegant comfortable and spacious enough but had just a limited drink selection and very limited food offerings as we were short in time we didn't visit the lounge in GRU. So overall mostly good flights which delivered us on time with no problems aside from the transfer in GRU. Recommended but I would be careful with connecting through GRU.

There was no attempt at warning anyone who was already checked in not to leave home very early to get to the airport even when the travel agent had over 25 people travelling. Unfortunately it then got worse. Returning to the airport on 9/11/13 I was unable to check in because no onward flights from Kuala Lumpur to Yangon were booked or available even though the previous day we had been reassured it would all be done and the travel agent had also been reassured. For the next 4 hours I had to queue at Customer Services hoping I wouldn't lose another day of my holiday. All they really seemed to want is for me to cancel the flight and go away. Eventually I travelled on Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways to Yangon who were great but the planes was full because of Malaysia Airlines. My luggage even managed to keep up.

Also the staff onboard were very accommodating when it was discovered that our tour company had not ordered me a vegetarian meal as requested. The air hostess very kindly let me have vegetarian crew meals and were most accommodating giving me a choice of meal each time. This went over and above the call of duty. We stayed in a China Southern hotel during our 18 hour stopover and were very impressed with the quality of the hotel.

In retrospect I wish I had because the seat I was in was incredibly uncomfortable and I was on an aisle so was able to stretch out a little unlike the guy next to me. The cabin crew were friendly the inflight entertainment very reasonable but the food was pretty poor to say the least and a lot of options had run out by the time they got to me (which I understand to an extent as I was one of the very last to be served due to my place on the aircraft). It might have been a bit of a blip as I loved them before but I'll certainly be plumping for Delta over Virgin in the future if given the choice.,Economy,5,2,4,2,3,3,3,2015,1
12039,16941,fiji-airways,M James,United States,Flew BNE-NAN as part of a longer itinerary in business. I wasn't provided with an express pass in BNE for exit immigration when I checked in though I barged my way through when they saw the biz class ticket. The ordinary line was 150 deep. The Qantas lounge in BNE used by FJ leaves something to be desired for an int'l biz lounge but it's adequate. The cabin condition on the 737 was worn. Service was excellent. The salmon in my lunch was rather desiccated from overcooking. Wines ok good spirit selection. Dessert was delicious and simple: a strawberry mousse cake. Would recommend.,Business Class,7,3,5,4,0,5,2,2014,1
2104,2855,air-canada,Wendy Tan,United States,"My son/college student booked a 7.30 pm flight from Rochester NY to Montreal QC via Toronto 11/26/13. Arrived at airport at 4 pm found counter unattended told that flight had been canceled. No notification via text/email/phone call. So stranded at airport. After several phone calls - with him calling and waiting over 1/2 hr to be connected then calling me for advice and me in California trying to help him I got on the phone. After 1/2 hr got connected and agent said nothing can be done and that my son's rebooked for next day. They wouldn't rebook on any other airline w/o Air Canada flight numbers even though United and USAir are partners in the Star Alliance. What I'm most upset about is the no notification of cancellation - agent checked and said system shows ""text not sent"". He talked to supervisor and found out that the system attempted to send a text to my son at 2 pm when the flight was canceled but the text did not go through. For such an important notification as a cancellation and you don't attempt to reach customer.",Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,11,2013,0

Cabin crew attentive and hard working throughout the flight. Good operation at LHR to board the aircraft. Frustratingly other aspects not top notch left LHR 55 minutes late (though to be fair the Captain did get us to arrive in Madrid only a few minutes late - another plus to Iberia) and then at MAD we had to wait 50 minutes for our luggage without any explanation. The aircraft is tired and elderly and needs to be replaced soon I think. My first experience of Iberia and despite concerns before the flight I would happily fly with them again. Things seem to be improving based on reviews etc.,Business Class,7,3,5,5,1,4,10,2014,1
3725,5020,air-transat,S Renaud,Canada,On the outbound flight the interior of the plane seemed to be poorly maintained. The seatback it front was bent and twisted this made it difficult to raise or lower the tray. The passenger in front kept trying to get it to recline with the help of the flight attendant by pushing on it which caused it to bend more. The audio jack didn't work so there was no sound to watch the movie. On the return flight Air Transat uses Enerjet. The plane was a 737 the legroom was terrible & I'm average hight. Also the plane wasn't equipped with entertainment so no music or movie for a 6 hour trip. This was a surprise as their website indicates they provide movies on their international flights.,Economy,4,1,5,4,1,3,5,2015,0
23906,36771,tigerair,Bojan Tercon,Singapore,I have to say that for a LCC I love Tiger. You pay very little for your ticket thus you cannot expect a premium product. My BKK-SIN flight left on time was predictable a new plane and got me home content. Given what I paid it matched my expectation. I got great service by check-in staff. Staff were accommodating and charged me less than they should have. The only thing they could do is introduce web-check-in for this flight.

The exit row seats while offering leg room are very narrow. The snack pack offered on the early EY11 departure was sufficient just before sleeping. The pre-landing breakfast was OK. It was a shame one isn't able to use the great IFE gate to gate.,Economy,7,3,5,5,5,5,10,2014,1

Afternoon GA flight on this route was not full as usual providing more legroom in advance due to vacancy on seats closer to me (while I got an aisle seat). Meal was adequate service was excellent but IFE needs more updates especially movies. Overall I was very satisfied with Garuda Indonesia's service which was equal to the price I spent.

19262,28668,qantas-airways,Roger Stone,Australia,BNE-PER-BNE two trips in 3 weeks and very pleasant flights. Good service free wine and reasonable food for economy. On one flight I boarded with an upset stomach and the flight attendant brought me some quality white wine from business class which helped enormously. Generally very full flights but on-time departures. I especially appreciated the careful route track selection to avoid headwinds on the westbound flights and to take advantage of these strong westerly winds for the eastbound flights meaning all flights either arrived exactly on time or were early. The Perth Qantas Club lounge is huge but at peak hour is still somewhat difficult to find space to sit down. Qantas have very annoying and intrusive people mover buggies sounding their warning sirens while moving around their Brisbane terminal (also the same in Sydney and Melbourne) - and mostly just transporting crew and friends about - what's wrong with a bell or soft honking horn as is the case in terminals such as Hong Kong? However flights themselves were very good on Qantas.,Economy,8,4,5,4,4,4,3,2014,1

11763,16595,etihad-airways,Justin Flynn,Australia,Business class MEL-AUH then economy AUH-LHR. Business class LHR-AUH and again J class from AUH-MEL. Originally booked the entire trip in economy but bidded using Etihad's online upgrade auction that is sent out to select customers. I was successful in all 3 bids. Quick note about economy - the 777-300ER aircraft used a 3-4-3 seating as a lot of airlines are doing these days. The seating is horrible and a massive step down from J of course. Leg room was just adequate. The business class legs were great. The individual 'suites' are very private although the window seats are better and more private than the aisle seats. Seat was comfortable and very comfortable when in 'relax' mode. My only complaint was the bed. Fully reclined the bed is 185cm and I am 184cm. There is no scope for letting your feet hang out over the end of the bed. For a premium product the bed simply isn't long enough for someone who only slightly above average in height. However due to some careful manoeuvring I did manage to get plenty of sleep. Overall the airline was fantastic although transiting between terminals in Abu Dhabi is a pain. The food and service from the cabin crew were wonderful and all flights were on time except or the AUH-MEL leg which was one hour late. The Arabic mezze I had for starters on each J leg was excellent and the lamb shanks were restaurant quality. I didn't drink much alcohol but on the MEL-AUH they had a very nice shiraz that I enjoyed 2 glasses of. Champagne is offered pre takeoff. Amenity kits were basic. The economy section was standard economy. No better no worse and for 7.5 hours wasn't too bad even with a full plane. The trip back from London was very painful for me emotionally as I had lost my mother the day before. The cabin supervisor couldn't have been more helpful.,Business Class,8,3,5,5,3,4,1,2014,1

25281,38613,united-airlines,Aija Hughes,United States,"My flight out from SFO was overbooked by 4 and there were some ""hold your breath"" moments until 4 people decided to give up their tickets and take an alternate flight. I had a connecting flight in Denver to Lincoln Nebraska. Fortunately I had a 3 hour layover in Denver which gave me plenty of time to walk from one end of the airport to the other for a connecting flight and believe me when I say it is a long haul. If anyone has a short time span to get to a connecting flight I suggest they arrange for a cart. Passenger space on United is cramped. I sat beside a big guy and had to lean well over into the aisle in order for both of us to be able to sit in the side by side seats. My return from Lincoln to SFO was a nightmare. I arrived in Lincoln got my boarding pass and when I looked at the pass and compared the time on it to the departure time listed on the board I noticed that departure was at least one hour later - which meant that I would miss my connecting flight in Denver. When I pointed this out to someone in the airport departure gate area they told me to get on the red phone to see if an alternate connection could be arranged. Once the plane finally arrived and I boarded there was still a good possibility that I would miss my revised connecting flight in Denver. I got on one of the cars that transport passengers from one gate to another arrived 15 minutes before the connecting flight was scheduled to depart and found that it also had arrived late and was just disembarking. This of course delayed the scheduled departure time of that flight. Finally to my relief I boarded the flight from Denver to SFO only to sit on tarmac for over an hour due to lightning thunder and rain. You pay for selecting seats you pay for luggage you pay for snacks and for the flight but you are packed into an exceptionally small seating space in which you cannot even fully put your tray down comfortably. Passengers should be treated better even if they fly economy.",Economy,3,1,4,1,1,1,6,2014,0

The first leg of my trip was a 1.5 hr flight from Aruba to Panama City and to my surprise we had a choice of warm sandwiches chips cookies and beverage. The chicken sandwich was pretty good for airline food but I can't complain because my flights from LAX to Las Vegas was a beverage and peanuts or pretzels. The second leg back home to Los Angeles was over a 5 hr flight leaving Panama City about 6:40 pm. After a couple of hours flying the beverage carts started serving drinks followed by a hot meal real silverware roll and salad. Before the flight ended there were two more rounds of beverages.

I found that this is airline is punctual and gives the standard care of an airline. Jeddah airport maybe one of the worst airports for connecting flights but its not fair to review the whole experience of Saudia based only on airport. This airlines offers a good price to travel with good food and good care throughout the flight. Of course the standard is not up to Emirates or Singapore Airlines but they are doing good job.

I found the onboard crew to be surly and not willing to help with a request for a glass of water or a passenger who had a nose bleed or helping in re-seating family groups who had been separated. We worked out the seating ourselves and in the end I moved twice to enable family groups to sit together. If travelling on an internal flight ensure that you eat and take a drink with you beforehand. Offered either a lolly or a box which proudly proclaims 'the contents of this box contain no preservatives. Please consume within 48 hours.'

The aircraft's were old but kept in a good state except for the washrooms which were disgusting. Seats were rather comfortable. On the Algiers-Ouagadougou leg 1st class seating was attributed randomly to economy passengers. The meals were excellent even on the shorter Paris-Algiers flights.

Happy with the Business Class product offered by Malaysia Airlines but if this airline wants to compete with the new player on the block in Adelaide Air Asia then clean the fuselages of your aeroplanes! A clean white Air Asia A330 (yes in all white colour) pulling up alongside Malaysia's sooty white fuselage is not a good look. Also noticed a dirty A330 at KL so ours was not a one off. Also hoping Business Class lounge at KL will be re-opened soon. One small gripe about food service lunch out of Adelaide was served at 11.30am after a 10 am departure. Was too soon. Two years ago a light breakfast was served with lunch later in the flight. Maybe a cost cutting exercise?,Business Class,10,4,5,4,5,4,1,2014,1

Somehow the ticket agents and boarding staff knew that we didn't pay for our tickets and from that point on the service ended. The man at the boarding desk actually said to me that I had no right to request better seats (the plane was only half full) because we didn't pay for our tickets.

I believe we had the latest business class seat and the storage space around this is excellent - a lot better than BA business class. Staff were attentive and polite. I declined the late night meal as I wanted to sleep but breakfast was very good. The only downside was in the earlier connecting flight LHR-MAD with the usual business arrangement for European flights i.e. economy seat but 3 seats between 2 people.

Flight attendants were very kind and even for this short flight (25min) to Athens they came around with a drink and a snack. The stopover in Athens was not very useful for us because we transferred to another gate to end up on the same plane we had came from with exactly the same cabin crew.

A message comes over saying sorry but we are also short on catering for the trip a piece of fruit cake a little yoghurt a bag of sliced apple and an orange juice. Lucky the staff were so nice. The trip home on the 3/8/2012 was worst - the flight was cancelled.

26949,40691,virgin-atlantic-airways,Martin Anthony,United Kingdom,We flew Upper Class from Grenada on 21st November. There isn't a Virgin lounge at the airport which was annoying. The actual flight back was really poor and the staff seemed to be just going through the motions. I was offered only one glass of wine with dinner and it was clearly a hassle when I asked for a second. Everything was done at great speed and we had the feeling that the staff just wanted to get it over and done with so that they could to sleep. For business class it was dreadful. An experience to be avoided. I walked away with the feeling that Virgin Atlantic has brilliant marketing but it's all style over substance.,Business Class,1,1,1,2,2,1,12,2013,0

On flight out to Palma I was unwell and could not have received better attention from the cabin crew. Extra legroom paid for on journey out - loads of room.

Seat was a little hard but I still managed to catch some sleep on all 4 legs. Food was fabulous except on the Singapore- London leg the pasta was dry and hard. IFE was excellent with a wide array of choices and the staff service was unmatched even in economy class. The Singapore girls were all very attentive yet friendly attending to our needs efficiently.

23963,36872,thomas-cook-airlines,I Driscoll,United Kingdom,TCX 1542 on June 30 was delayed for over 4 hours as a baggage handler drove into the rear door of the plan. This happened at 3am and when we checked in at 4.30 we were not told there was no announcement in departure lounge. Finally spoke to a representative at about 6.30 who said the plane had technical issues and to wait until 9am for the next bit of information. At 9.30 we were given GBP 6.50 voucher per person for food and told to come back at 11am. I only found out the nature of the delay after insisting on speaking to the duty manager. When on board (757-200) leg room not even big enough for my 18 month old daughter who continued to kick the seat in front. Same on the way back. Not impressed and will do everything possible to avoid TCX in the future.,Economy,2,1,3,1,1,3,8,2012,0

I have flown this route a number of time with British Airways and it was with some reluctance I booked my most recent trip with Korean Air based on the schedule they offer on the service. Well I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the service. Less seats in the Business Sections mean the cabin feels more spacious and the seat itself was bigger and more comfortable. The service from the cabin crew was excellent very attentive and keen to ensure I was looked after. Plenty of choice on the in-flight entertainment and the food was definitely better than what I have experienced with other airlines. The only negative would be the lounges both at Heathrow and Incheon - they are not quite up to the standard in terms of food being offered.,Business Class,10,5,5,4,4,4,7,2014,1
6378,8798,azerbaijan-airlines,M Rig,United States,Living in Baku Azerbaijan Airlines is often the cheapest and they code share with Qatar & Pegasus. Flights to Dubai quick and easy - although they seam to gate at the furthest gate in Dubai. It usually takes 2 hours to go through customs. There is always some kind of hot meal with local cheese. They usually have wine but not other alcohol. Flying to Tbilisi you are sometimes lucky and are put on the Qatar flight that flies Doha-Baku-Tbilisi. When using AZAL to connect to Pegasus (a large low cost carrier out of Istanbul) run to the transfer desk as AZAL does not ticket you through and everyone on the plane will need a transfer ticket. Also be aware that when you come back to Baku you will have to wait at the AZAL desk. People are seldom connecting to AZAL and on both occasions I have been the only one waiting at the transfer desk with no personnel for about 20 minutes. Don't plan any short connections as AZAL will not ticket you through on Pegasus. I have tried multiple times to register for their frequent flyer program online but it makes little sense and I have been unable to figure it out. You fly AZAL because it is usually direct and less expensive. I would hesitate to take them on a long haul flight. They are adding new planes and the new airport is incredible.,Economy,8,5,4,4,0,5,1,2014,1

As I was alone in the section I missed the European-style seats that would have allowed me to completely lie down instead of sitting with a 135° recline!

End up disappointed. Nothing special other than the fancy lighting on its windows and interior. The remote did not work thank goodness for touch screen TV. Food choice was either veg or non veg only both Indian cuisine. Portion was small ended up asking for a snack 3 hours after lunch was served. Cabin was messy by end of flight too many children on board unfortunately. Good points: Cabin staff were attentive to requests.

3989,5383,airbaltic,C Arnesen,Canada,Surprisingly pleasant experience despite prior scepticism. Properly educating yourself of Air Baltic's policies in advance is likely key here. AMS-RIX-ARN in Y solely for a 22-hour layover to see a bit of Riga. Paid baggage fees in advance checked in online. Staff in AMS and RIX pleasant and quick. No hassle picking up checked bags at RIX and re-checking next morning. Though we were very careful it turned out that hand luggage was never weighed in either AMS or RIX. Many frequent passengers with heavier bags did not seem concerned so I somewhat suspect this policy may be (very sensibly) a bit more relaxed now than it was; will go a long way for goodwill. Crews on both flights were attentive and surprisingly smiley for Eastern Europe (not a judgement just unexpected). Flights on time. B733 old but clean Q400 newer and also clean. Legroom standard for short European flights. Overall a pleasant experience. Would be cautiously optimistic to fly with BT again to RIX or if fares were significantly less than SK or KL on this route. Would recommend with caveat that one should carefully learn policies before booking.,Economy,8,4,5,0,0,4,9,2014,1

They have good leg space although the seats are narrow - narrowest I've ever experienced in a flight. It does not bother me personally but for a broader person this can be a real issue. They have upgraded their old entertainment system to something on par with AF/BA/KLM now, however that is only in the renovated planes. The food is as bad as it was, but I'd say that for the price this is to be expected. I never have any expectations regarding the food they will serve so I'm not disapointed. They are usually still the cheapest for CDG to YUL so if I wanted something a tad better I'd pay a bit more. The service is alright, of course it has nothing to do with 5-Star airlines but I'd say its decent for the price - and it has improved since the first times I flew with them 4 years ago.",Economy,7,3,4,2,5,4,6,2015,1

When I asked if our seats were together we were just brushed away. We boarded only to find out we had the very last seats facing the toilets.

Landed an hour late and ran through immigration and security to get to my ORD flight. A321 wasn't full - departed on time and sat on the runway for 2 hours due to a storm that came just as we were taken back to the terminal.

22103,34433,sunwing-airlines,R Moraine,Canada,We usually fly Sunwing to the Caribbean but after this trip we shall be looking for another airline for our holidays. The flight crews were good my main complaint is with the airline flight operations and reservations. We were told after we had booked our flight down to Cuba (Nov 22 from YOW) that it will be a would be a combined flight (MBJ and VRA) and that on the return trip to Canada the plane would be stopping in MBJ before picking us up at VRA. A couple of days before the flight the return leg was changed and that it would be VRA THEN MBJ giving us 2 seven hour flights. When the flights were combined we called the airline and got nothing but the usual run around and hiding behind their rules even when it was supposedly escalated 4 levels. But the topper was that on the return flight the MBJ passengers had to deplane and become transit passengers and VRA doesn't have a transit lounge. The MBJ were left to their own devices in the terminal causing the MBJ leg of the trip to be delayed by 30 minutes. On the flight down to MBJ from YOW we were delayed at the gate for paperwork which seemed to be a running thing with this particular captain. At MBJ they had to off load some of the VRA luggage to move it to another cargo hold. The captain said it was for weight and balance but a B737 isn't a Cessna 174. Lastly this is one of the TUI Travel PLC's Euro fleet and the in flight entertainment system didn't work properly. ON the YOW to MBJ portion a large number of the screens didn't drop down until the flight attendant crew trainer from the Euro division rebooted the entire system but then we were on the MBJ to VRA leg. Same thing again on the return to Canada.,Premium Economy,1,1,3,3,1,1,12,2013,0

I agree the legroom is not the best but you get what you pay for I'm well aware when I travel on a charter flight that your not going to get legroom so I cant understand why people complain about their seats. If you want comfort pay to go business class with British Airways. The seats in general were very good and the crew had told us that the aircraft had just had new seats fitted. Products are expensive to purchase on the flight but again its a charter flight not a scheduled airline so you have to expect to pay the airline is a business at the end of the day and has to make money! The meal was very nice made by James Martin and we had a choice of meal on way home something that my airline back in the day did not offer.

The return was pretty much the same except it was a dinner flight and they offered complimentary alcohol.

They use an A340-600 from the Cape to JNB and you'll sit - or lie - in SAA flat bed seats for a domestic flight of just 90 mins. If SAA only managed to teach their ground staff the same efficiency and friendliness that their onboard crews have I would have rated both trips a10 instead 9. I've rarely met more attentive polite and friendly flight attendants than on SA flights. Some airport staff on the other hand prefer to give you the impression as if they were forced to work there.

The check-in staff were essentially useless fobbing us off onto the gate staff. At the gate they were friendly but it was too late to be able to sort anything out by that stage. Eventually we were able to swap seats with the person next to my wife after she took pity on us.

Service was OK but cool and not very welcoming. Meals which we ordered in advance are poor and don't recommend them other than the Sandwiches and pot noodles which you can buy 'on the go'. The plane was full both ways. The worst experience was the freezing cabin on both flights so much so we became convinced that this was done to 'encourage' us to invest in renting pillows and blankets.

The trip to Singapore was ok but initially food of choice was not given to us until 30 minutes later they managed to find us the curry mutton. However the complaint I have about the flight is the return trip from Singapore stopover at Dubai to Heathrow. The first leg between Singapore and Dubai was fine. It is flight from Dubai to London on the 16th May 2015 which I am most unhappy about. At the start the flight was late. The air-conditioning was not working under the heat in Dubai. The pilot did inform us of the fault with the air-conditioning but that it would be fine once we were in the air. The flight was delayed 30 minutes and we were not given water from the flight attendants. For that reason I doubt if I will fly with Emirates again.,Economy,6,4,3,2,3,4,5,2015,0

The 5.5 hour flight from Cape Town to Mauritius was essentially in economy seats with an arm rest in between the seats with a partial recline. The 12 hour flight from Mauritius to Paris in a A340 was in a reclining seat except that it is not flat so you end up sliding down the seat with your feet getting squashed against the seat in front of you.

The second flight was 45 minutes late and had some of the most miserable cabin staff I have ever experienced. I wasn't even offer a drink to purchase. I would rate Germanwings as very average and certainly not what I would expect from a German carrier.,Economy,4,4,2,2,0,3,5,2013,0

5658,7758,american-airlines,C Sanders,United Kingdom,We flew from Manchester to New York at the end of August as a couple. We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service. Avoid AA if at all possible.,Economy,3,4,2,3,1,3,9,2014,0

We had notified the gate agents that we were on the way to the flight but they shut the door in our face and would not let us board. We found out they had overbooked the flight by 50 seats. On the next flight we watched as friends of the gate agents boarded on standby while the rest of us were bumped > again. No gate agents seemed interested in helping us get home. We eventually had to rent a car and drive home since American Airlines would not give us a seat on any flight to get home.

Definitely a step up from our GMP-HND flight on an ancient JAL Boeing 767. The KE flight was on a 777 with AVOD and excellent pitch and clean cabin. Cabin crew pleasant polite and efficient. The food was normal Korean Air bulgogi. You have it a thousand times but it always tastes pretty good! The negative aspect comes in the codeshare experience. As we purchased on Japan Airlines website Korean Air effectively shut us out with our elite status - no Morning Calm number on the reservation no Morning Calm mileage no Morning Calm preferred bag tags. We were actually seated on the very last row on a 750$ RT Y fare class ticket. We checked in at two hours like all Koreans do and were told that was ""the best seat."" I do give Korean Air staff one negative comment. The baggage handling at Gimpo was the slowest I've ever seen. I believe that Korean Air should have understood their timing better. Our flight arrived at 10:15 but our bags did not arrive until 11 PM - and Gimpo Airport is tiny. As such we (and the entire plane) missed the last buses to Seoul/other areas and and to pay for an expensive taxi. I really feel that as KE is so customer focused that they dropped the ball on this one. I know that it's part of the risk you take but Korean Air is usually good about those kinds of things. 50 minutes should have been enough time to get bags and out of tiny Gimpo Airport.

With the new high density configuration Air Canada has lowered themselves to a truly awful class of business travel. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped controls to recline are finicky and require a lot of to and fro'ing to get seat into lay down position. There is no storage space around your seat for storage of pillow blanket or your shoes. Staff are clearly not happy with new service nor are other frequent passengers. If traveling alone do not take an aisle seat on either side of the cabin - the window seat occupant cannot leave their seat without having you get out of your seat.

2793,3713,air-france,Stephen Gervais,Indonesia,"August 9th CDG-YUL on an older B747/400. This review is actually a continuation of my journey from CGK-SIN-CDG submitted in my earlier review. I am submitting this review separately due to the largely different journey experience. Once we boarded our flight we were told that our flight would be delayed due to a surprise inspection from the French Civil Aviation Authority. We were initially told the departure would be delayed by an hour. This was followed by an announcement that the inspection uncovered a technical problem and that we would have to deplane and change aircraft. We received meal vouchers to tide us over. We eventually departed 4 hours late for Montreal but were all glad to be finally on our way. Once on board I was approached by the flight attendant and asked to confirm that I had ordered a special meal. I was looking forward to my Indian meal especially since the meal from the previous flight from SIN had been so good. Instead I received a meal of ""Alaskan Pollack With A Leek Cream Sauce"" which had nothing to do with Indian food. When I mentioned this to the flight attendant her response was merely to say that she was also surprised to see this meal served as an Indian meal. After having eaten the presented meal the same flight attendant returned to me and asked me if I was satisfied with my meal. I politely answered that I wasn't satisfied because it wasn't what I ordered and expected. On the same flight I encountered a flight attendant with completely an opposite attitude who was very helpful in supplying me with ice packs to keep my insulin chilled since they were forbidden from storing my insulin in their on board chillers. This is probably why many passengers speak highly of Asian airline flight crews and often express positive comments about Asian service standards and service attitude.

BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine.

I sat in Row 3 (which is a bulkhead seat) and had more than enough legroom. Virgin Australia's major failing is the lack of In-Flight Entertainment onboard their 737s. The lack of In-Flight entertainment wouldn't matter on a short flight (Canberra- Sydney) but on a 2 hour flight it is a bit ridiculous. I would recommend bringing an iPad or Laptop with movies on if you want to watch movies. We were offered a sandwich and a biscuit for lunch which was very very plain. The seat was comfortable though it did appear that the bottom cushion had completely separated from the back portion of the seat. The head rest was very comfortable and the leather was a nice touch.

Even in so-called 'cattle class' it was an all time low.

This is the first time in a while I've been on VA since I've been traveling a lot on Lufthansa to Germany. It is too bad that this 4 seats in Economy to 3 seats in Premium Economy seem to be all about the profit margin.

3429,4629,air-new-zealand,E Smith,Australia,We travelled premium economy Melbourne to LA. It cost about double the economy return. The first leg (to Auckland) wasn't called premium economy although it was in the premium economy cabin and we paid for premium economy. It was called something like 'Works Plus' and you only got economy food. At Melbourne airport we were prevented from priority boarding because of this difference which seemed a bit pathetic. The great advantage of premium economy on Air NZ is that you get plenty of room and the seat in front can't recline into your space. The seats are not great there is no footrest and the seat doesn't flip up to support your feet. On the long flight you are given sort of foot-bean-bags which are quite handy but you aren't given those on the shorter leg. In fact on the first leg I had to be quite insistent to beg for a couple of ordinary cushions from a flight attendant who was very reluctant to hand them over! The seats are actually hard to operate which the staff are clearly aware of. A problem with the seats is that they all face slightly or considerably away from each other. Perhaps this is meant to be for privacy but personally I prefer to sit parallel to the person next to me even if I don't know him/her. It was frustrating not being able to talk properly to my husband on the flights. Another disadvantage of the configuration is that you can't comfortably lie down across both seats if the plane is empty (as it was on the way home from LA to Auckland-we would actually have been better in economy as everyone back there got a row each and could lie down properly! But of course you can't predict that). The food on the longer legs is nice but it seems very odd that they bring out the desserts with the starters and you have to sit and look and the dessert through your starter and main course. As the trays and tables are very small and a bit unstable this is actually a real pain. It is also difficult to get drinks served with your meal. They bring the drinks after the meals and personally I can't eat a meal without drinking something. In general the staff were pretty unhelpful. It was difficult to get a soft drink or orange juice at all times. I was also refused an inflight magazine when I asked. I was told they weren't produced and were 'online'. The safety video (Lord of the Rings-style) was incredibly annoying. So - lots of space but a not very good seat. Nice food but wobbly trays. Snarly staff in the main. Avoid the front row in premium economy as the configuration is even worse than the other rows.,Premium Economy,5,3,2,3,3,3,4,2015,0
26633,40248,vueling-airlines,Widya Gunawan,Indonesia,"Scheduled departure supposed to be 2.30pm - however they keep delaying the flight without giving the exact time to fly. There's no solutions for the passenger on what supposed we do. No clear explanation from the airlines of what's going on. Only one lady try to answer passenger question one by one, which very uneffective and unprofessional for airlines.  We are tourist in Europe and thought using airplane will be faster way compare to train. Unfortunately, it was the other way around. It's very dissapointing experience using Vueling. We also try to change using other airlines however our luggage has been checked into the Vueling and we unable to take it back. ",Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,2015,0
3592,4836,air-new-zealand,Romeo Liebig,New Zealand,I recently took Air New Zealand to Sydney as part of a ticket with connections to a Vietnam Airlines Flight. Arrived early at Auckland Airport checked in with a customer service staff as their cost cutting exercise with no check in counters means that the check in kiosk does not work for when taking connecting flights and having to check your bags through. Arrived early at the gate ready to board at 6.15 am only to board 10 minutes prior to departure meaning we departed late as they have just one staff in charge of the boarding process. When on board felt like a sardine especially with the larger man in front of me with the seat bending back badly. Aircraft certainly ageing and seat very hard and uncomfortable. Food and drink okay but very basic. Entertainment outdated as well was watching something had already seen before. The Air New Zealand staff very casual and not really smiling at all and don't really care about the passengers as long as they are being paid. Can not recommend taking Air New Zealand again.,Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,2014,0
3837,5205,air-transat,Bobby Giannakopoulos,Canada,YUL-ATH-YUL with an Airbus A330 on both legs. I've flown and rated this airline a few months before and this time it was a bit better. The check in process in Montreal and Athens airport went smooth. The seat comfort was good on the inbound because it was the emergency exit row and for the return leg it was fine I was flying on stand by so no complaints. The service and the crew onboard was fine nothing special and the meals were not the best. On the return leg there was an unscheduled stop in Shannon for refuelling (probably because of the weight restrictions) and we were informed when we were onboard. Entertainment was good with a screen on each seat despite it sometimes pausing - the movie selection was the same on both legs. Overall I think this airline is overrated but it's not too bad and it offers a better product and service than the other airlines on the same route.,Economy,7,3,3,3,4,3,10,2014,1

12973,18527,frontier-airlines,B Zimbelman,United States,I checked in online the night before but did not have my boarding pass. I also was not checking any bags. I made it to the ticketing/baggage check counter right at 45 minutes before the flight time. I was told that I could not check in. Rather than wait in line I remembered seeing signs that you could get through security using your smart phone. I verified this with the agent before I went through security. Unfortunately I only had the pdf document downloaded to my phone and that was not sufficient. I needed to have the little speciality square that these smart phones can read. I had to return to ticketing to change my flight because I was definitely going to miss the flight. Then I had to fly standby and hope I could get on a later flight. So my lack of knowledge regarding the scanning/smart phone procedures did me in but it all started when the first agent gave me bad information. The agent that finally provided me with a boarding pass verified that the 1st agent should have been able to issue the boarding pass - it was only checking in at that point that required her. In hindsight I should have argued with the 1st agent or requested that he check with someone more experienced (or who was listening to me).,Economy,2,3,1,0,0,3,3,2013,0

9159,12538,china-eastern-airlines,T Mukherjee,United States,On July 20th I took off from Beijing to Kunming via China Eastern flight #5706 on my way to Kolkata (via flight# 555). The plane leaving from Beijing to Kunming was late by two hours. I missed the connecting flight to Kolkata. There was no guidance or help at Kunming. I picked up my checked luggage and went to the terminal for the connecting flight. I found a lot of confusion at the ticket counter and finally gathered that I had to wait for the same flight next night. The next day after receiving the boarding pass I arrived at the departure gate where the plane was delayed for more than hour - no announcement no apology. My return trip from Kolkata to the USA was to be via China Eastern. Instead I bought a one-way ticket via another airline.

Candies were offered before take off. Snacks consisted of sandwich and yoghurt; this was for the morning flight to Prague. The evening flight from Rome also offered a sandwich and juice. Good coffee was available. The economy seats were comfortable for my Asian size. But the seat seems to be of standard size whether on an Asian American or European airline. The A320 cabins were clean. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. Check in at Fiumicino and Venizelos airports were fast and straight forward. The only inconvenience we experienced was at Athens airport. It was a late night arrival past 11pm but there was still the hassle of getting off the plane and riding a bus to the terminal. I thought all Aegean jets were not using the tube seeing several of their planes parked in the tarmac at some distance from the terminal. That wasn't the case with the morning flight to Prague as the plane was connected to a tube. Overall value for money is satisfactory. We'd choose Aegean again if an opportunity arises in the future.,Economy,8,3,4,4,0,4,10,2012,1

18774,28071,qantas-airways,C Penrose,Australia,Flew from Singapore to Sydney. There was no reason why the plane left late as it was sitting at the gate four hours before departure. The plane left 30 minutes late and by the time we got to Sydney it was put into a holding pattern because it was late. By the time it landed it was nearly an hour late. Because of this we and many others missed connecting flights. Qantas on time performance is a joke. They got us to Singapore an hour late and nearly matched it on the way back. Going through customs we explained the situation to the officer and he said most Qantas planes were late. If you need a connecting flight steer well clear of Qantas as you will miss it.

The cabin crew are not attentive and a smile is seen as a bonus the whole thing seems to be a cattle truck these days. Our flight was delayed (these things happen) but there is little in the way of welcome when boarding and the crew clearly don't want to be there just simply going their motions. The headphones were broken both outbound and inbound tea and coffee unavailable inbound soft drinks well what can I say self service with a disinterested crew. Inflight was very disappointing to say the least some of the lowest quality I have come across in my travels. Drinks were simply rushed through and on 2 occasions had the cup and/or tray taken from my wife even though she was still eating! Not once but 2 times the reason was simple they wanted to rush through and get the job done for their benefit and not the customer. Overall the crew were unprofessional and left numerous blinds down during landing and were even walking around the cabin with the seat belt signs on! I doubt that conforms with their operations practices. This was a good airline but now seems to behave as if they're doing the customer a big favour.,Economy,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2015,0

The planes were very clean and comfortable. FA's were excellent although perhaps lacking a lot of the spark they used to have. Flights were both on time and very efficient. What shocked me was the food offering. Since when did flying Qantas become a no frills airline in terms of food. Served in cardboard boxes the food was uninspired. Breakfast was a hard cold cake/bread type of ""thing"" along with yoghurt and granola. The coffee was dreadful. Dinner was a cold chicken and potato salad. What shocked me was that you used to get a proper breakfast and dinner hot and quite tasty for airline food. The food was delivered so quickly and taken away so quickly it was like being in a cheap cafeteria. While Sydney Airport is immaculate and very well presented Melbourne Airport was dirty and looking very worn. Sydney Airport was renovated for the Olympics and is well maintained and updated. Melbourne looks like it did 10 years ago and like it hadn't been touched in 10 years especially in terms of maintenance.

At the gate one employee handled boarding and she had to check a number of bags because the overhead bins were inadequate for a typical carry on.

When I asked the steward about the headsets she was annoyed that I didn't purchase on the computer screen. I really didn't want to wait another hour and she basically threw them at me and said to pay for them when I got a chance. On my flight home March 9 2015 as I was boarding the steward told the boarding agent that there was no more room for luggage in overhead bins. I was not happy about giving up my bag as I had things in there that should not go in a checked bag. She was insistent.

The flights were on time except for the last leg which was 45 minutes late (but was still acceptable for reaching my afternoon meeting). What motivated to write this review are two things: 1) I was impressed by the service on the CPH-LIN flight. Especially on the return flight I was treated extremely nicely by the staff. They even packed me a lunch bag with food and drinks for my over-night stay at CPH airport ( I arrived at 0.45 and my connection was at 6.15 am so hotel was not really an option). 2) I really enjoyed the shower service at the CPH lounge.

Flight times: 2hr delay on outbound flight plus the pilot had to take us via a longer route to avoid turbulence - meant we arrived 2.5 hours late into Cancun! Flight back was better with only a 40min late arrival. Food: Cooked food poor and on the inbound flight they had sold out of most snacks and wine by the time they got to our seat - no apology. No free water which is deplorable on a 13hr flight (outbound flight) and a 9hr flight (inbound). Staff service: Could hear flight attendants talking loudly and swearing just before take off and landing (on both flights). Toilets: 2 of the 4 toilets in economy were out of order by the end of the first flight and the part of the plane we were in smelled terrible. Seats: OK. Despite the fact we checked in 2hrs early we weren't able to sit together on the outbound flight but got seats together on the inbound flight as we arrived 3hrs early!

The transfer connections were easy and nearby. You don't have to go through security for a second time and you don't have to dash to another faraway terminal. The 737 flights between CAN and BKK were so so. You're packed in in 3 across tight seating.

I flew off peak hours so I benefited from a quick check-in with a personable agent. The YYZ-NRT boarding was the usual rush of pax. It would be nice if AC moved the priority lane to one side and it was better labelled so people don't accuse priority boarders of pushing in the line. Not a full flight so FAs had an opportunity to take their time and provide decent service. Food and beverages better than usual and overall I have noticed AC has shown some improvement in its food quality in the past year. Unfortunately the wine selection is still hit and miss. The seat showed its age and was well used. The IFE selection was boring and I resent the forced commercials. It was a good flight and I was able to catch a few hours of sleep. The problem was with the return flight. It was cancelled due to equipment issues. It happens but it seems to be an increasing scenario at AC. The AC response to the issue was disorganized and slow. Personnel tried their best. The end result was hours wasted at the airport until AC sent Pax off to a hotel. Communication was poor. The concierge in NRT was professional although it took some time to get an answer. The lady in YVR who assisted was also professional and kind. Unfortunately the replacement flight the next day was also beset by equipment issues as the air conditioning system wasn't working well and the cabin was stuffy and hot for the flight to YVR. However FAs on this flight were the best I have had on AC. I seem to be encountering an increasing number of equipment issues and delays with AC.

The total delay was over 2 hrs because of strong headwinds. The plane was immaculate as it was one of Air Canada's new B787-800s. The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses. Many people pressed the attendant call button or the overhead light unintentionally by resting their elbows on the buttons.,Economy,7,3,4,3,5,4,4,2015,1

The crew kept my champagne on ice until we were ready for it with fresh Orange juice on the house in case we wanted to make Bucks Fizz. Snacks were handed out at various points in the journey and we arrived in Puerto Vallarta feeling surprisingly fresh for an 11 hour journey. On the return journey airport reps were helpful and friendly and the cabin crew were as friendly as always. After arrival back in Manchester the two captains and first officer were happy for me to join them in the cockpit for some photographs and a brief chat about the aircraft. My only slight criticism about the 787 is that the entertainment system seems particularly prone to crashing and freezing up but the crew were happy to reset it for me and provided a free beverage when they weren't able to immediately rectify it.

We were not informed as to what was going on and when asked if I would make my connecting flight in Dallas I was told that I would find out when I got there. When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour, which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long. The only thing that made the flight bearable is the fact there was movie service from the flight from Dallas to Las Vegas ($8 for a movie). I attempted to just check in online for my flight leaving tomorrow morning only to find out it told me my request could not be processed and I had to check in at the airport. I called the customer information number listed on the website only to be told it wasn't processing because I did not have a seat on my connecting flight from Dallas to Monroe.

Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it.

Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in.

27062,40863,vueling-airlines,Willy Verwoerd,Norway,After several pleasant flights with Vueling providing fair value I have now left them. The reason for this is their new luggage policy since last time: Be aware that Vueling now has a total luggage allowance of 23 kg per passenger. No not per suitcase per passenger. No matter how many cases you bring you'll have to pay for excess luggage if your total is more than 23 kg. As an example I was on the point of booking a flight from Prague to Alicante (which goes via Barcelona) when fortunately I discovered this in time. I was going to bring two cases at 20 kg each. This would have cost me 60 euros for the two cases plus 17 kilos of excess luggage at 12 euros per kilo giving a total of 264 euros!

Check in at Dulles was rather easy with checking in one bag at the counter and carrying on our other small suitcases. At the gate the staff were a little confusing and boarding a little chaotic. Our seats were next to a window and there was sufficient leg room for me as I am 6 ft’4 and obviously sensitive to cramped quarters. On the outgoing flight the flight attendants were a little hurried. The inflight entertainment was dated and limited and there wasn't any play/pause controls for the movies so you wound up joining a film that already started. The food was fair and on the bland side and beer and wine ran about $10 for a glass. Later on breakfast was served and it was terrible and I noticed that many guests skipped eating most of it as did I. Our return trip started off on the wrong foot as the check in kiosk required a number that was not on my e-ticket and I had to wait in line for check in assistance. After that I had to wait again to check my one bag and was told that our carry-ons now exceeded the weight limit and we had to check them both for $109. Not having the time to dispute and with a long line behind us I just paid the fee and decided to move on. The departure gate was chaotic as well the food bad as before and the same tired movies were on the flight as well.

I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,Economy,4,3,2,2,4,4,5,2014,0
13254,18896,germanwings,H Mutschler,Germany,Flew over the weekend CGN-ZRH. Booked Lufthansa but got Germanwings due to LH changing operation in Europe to 4U. First leg was late over 40 minutes with no explanation done when the gate crew announced a 2nd delay of another 15-20 minutes due tyres had to be changed the gate was open to board. Take off was just after boarding so there was no tyre change. So no more Snacks and Drinks unless you pay for it. Bought muffin and coffee quality ok but you pay. Return flight was on time crew at gate much nicer. Cockpit gave information about the flight. Crew served beer for 3 Euros. Would that this flight would be LH again.,Economy,3,4,3,2,1,3,8,2013,0
20398,30555,silkair,B Sharma,Singapore,I flew SIN-CJB-SIN in Economy Class on November 17th and 29th. I have flown on this route twice before (in 2009 and 2011) but the flights had since been retimed to be more convenient. Both flights were close to 100% full. The aircraft were two very new A320-233s (9V-SLR and -SLQ respectively) and each flight took just over four hours. The Economy Class seats were fairly comfortable with adequate lumbar support and average pitch and legroom. Seat recline was limited though. One of my biggest gripes about flying with SilkAir is the lack of in-seat screens which many other airlines in the region and worldwide have fitted in their narrowbody Economy Class cabins. In- flight entertainment was the Silkwinds magazine (a fairly interesting read) and overhead screens showing silent films which in my opinion is insufficient for any flight of over two hours in duration. Drinks and a packet of nuts were offered a few times during the ascent cruise and descent and at mealtimes. The meals (lacto-ovo vegetarian in my case) were satisfactory though not as good both in terms of quality and quantity as the meals served onboard parent company Singapore Airlines' shorter flights. It is worth noting however that all service was conducted very courteously and to very high standards. Also worth noting is SilkAir's new 30 kg checked baggage allowance which I found very useful. All in all for the price paid (S$641.80 round-trip per adult) SilkAir offered fair value for money - though I hope to see an improved onboard product with the arrival of the airline's first B737-800s next year.,Economy,7,4,5,3,2,3,12,2013,1

26928,40653,wizz-air,M Salway,United Kingdom,Luton to Budapest. Absolutely no problems at all got the extra leg room option which gives priority boarding. This meant we got on first and had large comfy seats and no stress. Nobody sat next to us so had loads of room. Plane was new clean and on time. Only issue we had was being corralled into a concrete shed with no facilities at Budapest airport which seemed a cruel way to treat anyone. Ryan air did the same though and their plane was late. I see loads of other complaints but if you actually read the instructions have the right sized luggage and print boarding passes before you go it's hard to go wrong.,Economy,9,4,4,3,0,5,2,2015,1
20118,30009,saudi-arabian-airlines,Dawood Fakhruddin,Bahrain,Mumbai-Riyadh-Bahrain. Mumbai to Riyadh was Boeing 777-200. 90% of passengers were Indian blue-collared workers. The FA's were welcoming to everyone alike. Everyone was greeted with a smiling face. Mango/orange juice was served and the lunch service began. Food was hot (had to wait for 5 minutes for it to cool down). Inflight entertainment was fairly good. Unfortunately our row's computers weren't responding. Stopover at Riyadh was 4 hours. The airport had charging points and many cafe's with affordable drinks and eatables - gets boring if you dont have personal entertainment. Riyadh to Bahrain was an Embraer 35 seater. The scheduled duration was 1 hour 10 minutes but the actual time taken was just 50 minutes. 10 minutes after takeoff lunch was served (goes without mentioning it was piping hot) the meal was filling with salad dessert and a main course. The trays were taken back within 20 minutes. In short the entire 10 hours journey was pleasing and worth the cost. I should mention that I got the ticket for 1/5th the original price because of a special offer. Worth every penny and I wouldn't mind paying the whole fare as well.,Economy,10,3,5,5,1,5,5,2014,1

What was disappointing was the poor KrisWorld in-flight entertainment system. It was really old. The display on the screens were barely visible and that the buttons on the controls were hard to press. The seats was a bit cramped on the older planes. On food SIA met its expectations.

13822,19854,iberia,T Powell,Spain,MAD-GVA-MAD. A pre confirmed aisle seat which magically turned into a center seat during check in was a bad start. I am 5 feet 10 inches and the space between the bottom of my back and my knees is greater than the space between the rows of seats on the A320. That means sitting with both legs either pointing sideways or spread apart either way extremely uncomfortable. No food or beverage but items for sale but with the seating position there is no way I can get my wallet out of my trouser pocket to pay anyway. This is an exceptionally unpleasant experience but if you have short legs and no service needs Iberia might be the airline for you. They have taken to making lots of customer friendly announcements including the catch phrase 'The Joy of Flying' which I find exceptionally hypocritical.,Economy,2,1,3,1,1,2,3,2014,0

25818,39269,virgin-atlantic-airways,John Bryant,United Kingdom,"We had booked premium economy with a view to seeking an upgrade to Upper Class using the 10's of thousands of miles we have. Upgrades were available, but not for miles but for a payment of £1500 each. Apart from this the ground service was fine. The aircraft was a Dreamliner delivered the previous day. Very smooth flight, we were told that the flexible wings smooth out almost all but the worst turbulence. What excuse will the crew now use to get a break? Food was a choice of Shepherds Pie, Curry or vegetarian. The Shepherds Pie was tasty but was tiny, a very thin layer of minced lamb covered by a very thin layer of potato. The blackberry sponge had sunk at one side and was cold and clammy. Seats were the biggest problem. Yes they are wider than economy and have 38"" pitch, but the one in front still reclines into your face and if that person reclines fully then your entertainment screen does not hinge enough to allow you to watch it without you also reclining your seat. Some airlines now have seats were your seat base slides forward so you recline within you own space. They even supply small packets of mints giving you tips on how to ""surreptitiously"" recline your seat without making it too obvious. Crew were fine as were the drinks, and a very nice red wine with dinner. However, I can't help feeling that they have missed an opportunity to overtake their competitors by fitting old style seats.",Economy,3,2,3,2,4,2,7,2015,0
9111,12489,china-eastern-airlines,M Kuroz,United States,JFK-PVG (Shanghai) round-trip. Onboard I found the flight attendants did not speak English well and were not too interested in doing their jobs. The food choices quality and quantity were not better than my experiences in economy class of other airlines. On the JFK-PVG flight the menu was handed out for dinner and quickly collected back as if they were hiding something. Well they were as I realized on the flight back. After dinner I had to ask about dessert and a small container of ice cream was handed out. I saw a passenger having cheese I asked for it on the trip back and was reluctantly offered it. 8 hours into the flight flight attendants walked around with small sandwiches. The breakfast after this horribly long flight was not memorable and was worse than dinner. The seats are not lie-flat and were not that comfortable for an overnight flight of over 14 hours. Return flight was not much better. The menu was handed out and not collected until near landing time at JFK. Interestingly there were 3 meal services listed (Lunch Light Snack Breakfast) but only 2 were served on this 14.5 hour flight. Again meals were of economy class quality service was slow uneven and not enthusiastic. Beverage service was slow and geared towards minimizing consumption. As far as I could see I was the only one who got the cheese plate because I asked for it and the flight attendant reluctantly complied. Same quality seats as the outbound leg. While Business was really more like Economy Plus in terms of service there is also a small First Class cabin on these flights which appeared to be more comfortable with the lie-flat seats that have become popular on other carriers. A few words about Business class lounges. At JFK it was run by some other airline and was no better or worse than the usual JFK lounge. At Shanghai I would rate the lounge as one of the better ones I have experienced. The beverages and snacks were fine and suitable for the western palate. All in all I would not recommend this airline for business class.,Business Class,2,2,2,2,4,3,1,2013,0

The Dreamliner seats are small and uncomfortable. I am only 5ft 7"" and my knees were touching the back of the seat in front of me. The food was disgusting and I laughed when they would only allow each passenger 1 sugar packet for their tea or coffee as they forgot to restock. They had also forgotten to put onboard the landing cards for arrival so it was a mad scramble at immigration to fill them out. The return journey was worse. I checked in and requested an emergency exit seat knowing how cramped I was on the outbound flight which I got. My relief didn't last long though when I checked in to the gate they informed me they had changed aircraft and there were no emergency exit seats left so they put me at a window seat. The aircraft they changed to was an Airbus 330 no seat back TV's and the sound wasn't working on the over head television.

Although the equipment is old and the seating is cramped the overall flight experience was good. Advance check-in eliminated the hassle of YUL check-in and aside from a change in gate at departure everything went smoothly. Changing my departure on the return was easily done at the airport by a pleasant agent. I used the MLL in YUL courtesy of my Elite status. Although the lounge was crowded I was surprised by the improved range of food available. The MLL agent was polite and smiling (in the past they have been grouchy). Significant improvement at the YUL MLL in the last year. The departure area at YTZ is shared with Porter and is run down shabby and crowded. Both flights were nearly on time despite weather conditions. This was my first use of AC at YTZ in many years as I have been a loyal client of Porter. I gave AC a try because of my displeasure with my past Porter flights specifically the deterioration in service and on time performance. AC is just as good if not better than Porter on this route and with my FF status the AC experience was superior overall. AC is excellent when there are no IROPS no baggage and it is a short haul flight.,Economy,9,2,4,3,1,5,10,2014,1

On half of my flights middle seat was occupied. SAS has professional crew with positive attitude towards you. Pillows and blankets were provided for early departure. Flights were on time and procedures both at the airport and on board were smooth and fast without a rush. 22hrs before flight it is possible to download free newspapers and magazines from their app I think this is great idea enjoyed reading them on trip to airport in lounge and onboard.

The service was very good and the food choices also very good. The return flight was on the 16th November. Check in again very easy. The flight itself was a day flight on a A440 the plane itself although a bit old was ok. The seats were larger than economy but still comfortable but again the footrest would not come up resulting in swollen feet again. However the service was absolutely first class as was the food so this made it worthwhile.

At the European airports, everyone was asked to board at the same time. When we confronted Icelandair, they said they didn't have the facilities to do this. You don't need facilities.

I agree that a can of coke and small pringles is not the best ""health"" option but I bought my own food on board and there was no problem with that. Take an empty water bottle to refill. Don't try and take the bottled water through Gold Coast Customs - no go so you'll have to stand there and scull it! Scoot staff were fine and efficient.

Also no jarring announcements or being pestered to buy scratch cards. National carriers are also often a small window on the country to which you are travelling so it was nice to have staff that were actually Irish. Terminal 2 in Dublin is also much easier than T1.

The seats do not recline completely flat but I was comfortable enough to be able to get to sleep. Earplugs and blindfolds were also provided which gave me a more peaceful rest. Generally cabin crew were friendly especially when you talk to them personally. They could have smiled at bit more however in other situations such as when they are serving food and beverages. Special mention to the fresh fruits that I had for breakfast which had amazing presentation on the plate! Overall pretty positive experience just a few little things that TG should look at to enhance the experience for customers.,Business Class,7,3,4,4,4,4,1,2014,1

The food and beverages were more than enough with a very good choice between different kinds of meals. The staff in Hanoi was very helpful and guided me personally to the transfer counter and the security check - so everything was easy to find. The short flight from HAN to SIN (2.5 hours) on A321 was excellent. Staff were friendly and cared about passengers. Beside the short flight there were printed menu cards and a choice between three menus. Both flights were on time and gave me a very good impression of VNA.,Business Class,9,4,4,5,3,4,4,2013,1

The flight departed on-time (9.10am), service on the flight was excellent with the in-flight meal extremely tasty. We were served sausages with an omelette. The layover in Kingston, Jamacia was interesting with beautiful views of the ocean (there was a non stop flight to Orlando the next day but I needed to arrive one day early so I had to make a stop). Once again we were on our way to Orlando, this time there was only a beverage service due to the short flight, we arrived in Orlando on-time 3.15pm.

First off I had to pay for poor entertainment offered inflight when other airlines offer better entertainment for free. I mean I paid for movies that I can't even pause when I use the restroom (ridiculous). Secondly no food was served for this long flight. Even some chips or light snacks would have helped.

My booking for 8th June was cancelled by the airline due to cancellation of their KMG-CCU flight on June 8. At that time (a month before) I was given the option to cancel the entire booking but it was too late and any fresh booking would cost me much more so I opted for the date change to June 9. However when I arrived for check-in at PVG they refused to provide through check-in to CCU and said that I would have to collect my baggage at KMG and go for a fresh check-in. This was ridiculous since PVG is the home base of China Eastern and they can easily manage to put systems in place for through check-in for through bookings. But they refused and when I met the duty supervisor she told me to contact the check-in counter at KMG for immediate check-in. However as expected when I arrived at KMG at midnight none of their counters were open. I managed to locate the duty supervisor who refused to help out. I had to spend money and stay in a hotel. When I returned to the airport the next day around 6 pm again they refused to check me in until 9 pm.,Economy,4,3,3,2,2,2,6,2014,0

Lounge in Singapore was better than I expected after reading reviews small selection of hot and cold food and small drinks selection but it was cool and fairly quiet. Good priority boarding at Singapore and bus transfer at Doha - separate bus exclusively for business class. On both legs we were welcomed on board by name and shown to our seats and given pre takeoff drink and the offer of a newspaper and amenity bag provided. Pyjamas were only provided on the Singapore-Doha leg. At all times we were referred to by name and after takeoff CSD introduced themselves staff checked that we knew how all the controls worked on the seat and IFE I witnessed them showing great patience helping an elderly gentleman get to grips with the IFE. We were provided with a wine and food menu and it was explained that we could dine as and when we wanted. The food and wine selection was very good and the food was presented very well. The cabin crew were continuously walking the cabin quietly offering service when it was required. Found the seat very comfortable in all positions and managed to sleep for around 4-5 hours on each leg.

More often than not the plane is parked on the tarmac vs. at a gate and there are inordinate delays as the busses don't leave till they are absolutely full - if you are travelling first or business and have got off first or had priority boarding - it really makes no difference as you end up waiting in the bus.

The plane was looking old (in economy noted that first class and business looked like they had been renovated). My entertainment system did not work on the first flight. Rarely have I found an airline meal so bad I would not eat it but the Hake was disgusting and the scrambled eggs the next morning also awful. On the first flight the cabin crew were abrupt I realise it was a full flight but I still expect pleasantness. The service was minimal and seemed rushed and a bit sloppy. I thought it might have been just me but when I caught up with my husband and son who had flown the same route two days earlier we laughed because they too had exactly the same experience.

20527,30773,singapore-airlines,L Lee,Australia,Travelled on SQ211 on 16 May 2015 Singapore to Sydney in Economy seat 32G. Flight was full mainly connecting passengers coming in from India. Our second (light) meal was served very late almost at the time when the pilot made the announcement for cabin crew to prepare flight for arrival and some passengers including myself were still waiting to be served! It was rather stressful to rush through my meal knowing the plane was arriving soon. Apparently the reason why the second meal was served so late was due to the high volume of special meal requests from the Indian passengers. I am a Kris Flyer Frequent traveller and travel often on the Singapore to Sydney leg and have experienced/observed this problem before where the meals are served later than usual because cabin crew are serving a high volume of special meal requests. Perhaps SIA need to review the management of special meals on future flights where there are many passengers travelling from India to Sydney via Singapore. It will be interesting to ask SIA how they will manage if 90% of the passengers have special meal requests on one flight! So this was quite a let down in service for me. I also have a suspicion that the in flight meals served have become smaller and lighter in portions. Another problem was my seat TV did not have Entertainment on demand! It was most disappointing especially when I was informed while most of the other passengers had Entertainment on demand programs mine was one of the few that did not have it! Surely this type of problem should be noted by cabin crew at the end of its last flight for service maintenance. I think SIA needs to pull up its socks to maintain its renowned high standards!,Economy,5,3,1,1,1,3,5,2015,1

Short trips so no entertainment etc. A snack was served which was basically a sandwich and a dessert; not great. Not much was expected. The cabin crew were fine although a little passive when fellow passengers were clearly ignoring instructions during take-off and landing. My main issue (which would lead me to recommend only with caution) is the number of times our flight times and numbers were changed. We did receive one notification of a schedule change but the flights we actually ended up on did not match the info. provided. Other passengers reported the same issue.

1255,1912,air-berlin,Joerg Boese,Germany,Palma-Hamburg Economy. The plane was a A330 which was fully booked. The boarding process was disorganized (no zone calls big queues) and as a result of the chaotic boarding we lost our departure slot and had to wait about 40 minutes for a new one. The inside of the plane was a little old the seats were moderately comfy but quite narrow. Air Berlin offers hot meals for a surcharge. The crew did take orders but forgot all passengers in my section. Since they were also not reacting to call buttons I got my meal about two hours into the flight and it had to be removed quite soon since the flight is only about 2.5 hrs long. Arrival delay was 40 minutes. Baggage delivery in Hamburg took over one hour.

My long flight from Sydney to Dubai was rendered intolerable by a crying infant but the comments that follow concern only the Qantas provision. Cabin crew: brusque and uninterested in passengers. From start to finish all members gave the impression they had a lot of hard work to do. Why is a smile something so difficult to provide? There was no pre-service of aperitifs (even though aperitifs were listed on the menus handed out at the start). The food was excellent: I really enjoyed the taste of all that was offered on both legs of my SYD-LHR trip. Wine appeared to be supplied grudgingly and there was no offer of ""seconds"" of coffee — routine on BA flights. Legroom on the A380 was adequate. The plane was clean. The seats were not comfortable — after a bit their hard pressure on the backs of the thighs became annoying.

The planes are a bit old but the service was good. The staff were excellent (especially in Luxor). Everyone went the extra mile to make our flights as comfortable as possible.

12308,17378,flydubai,K Redwine,United Arab Emirates,Overall I was impressed with the efficiency and professionalism of FlyDubai and staff. Several negatives stand out however that fellow travelers should pay attention to. First you need to understand the business model requires paying extra for everything. Your assigned seat any checked luggage water or food on the flight inflight entertainment - you name it. The first flight I was on had no video onboard not even screens on the center aisle. Second the return flight had video but the quality of the touch screens was so poor and unmanageable that I was not even tempted to watch a movie for fear of it being messed up. I noticed very few people watching movies on the screen - instead they read or watched movies on the tablets. I also noticed that the flight staff struggled to get the touch screens they used to work. They had to keep touching them to get it to respond. They really should fix that. The flight staff were professional but only one of the two stewardesses was friendly. Thirdly the return flight was delayed one hour with no explanation from the rather unfriendly ground crew who were running the door. As a result we got into Dubai 40 minutes late - and then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our luggage after getting through passport control! This was very frustrating at the end of a long day especially as there is no excuse for this is a modern airport. I don't think I will fly the airline again because on top of this I had to pay AED 640 for my car to be parked for 5 days in long term parking. Coming from Abu Dhabi to Dubai I would have been better to take a cab. This is not the airlines fault but fellow travelers would do well to be aware of this one.,Economy,4,3,3,3,1,3,10,2013,0

There were literally thousands of people waiting to check in to United flights in PVR with lines stretching the length of the entire terminal. Only four check in desks were open one was even closed. There were no announcements and a United rep went through the lines asking for passengers on the next flight only once. Flights out of PVR were delayed by as much as 2 hours or more. There was no help in Houston for people who would miss their connections. I arrived at my gate just before the door closed and the sullen attendant at the desk refused to ask permission for me to board. A few minutes later the door even opened to let out a passenger who had been checked into the wrong flight and the (now two) attendants refused to try to get me on board. This was the last flight out to DC and as a result I had to stay overnight in Houston.

8229,11436,british-airways,Connie Green,United Kingdom,Recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a BA promo to fly in to Singapore and then to Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific and back to UK. Our flight out to Singapore was easy and relaxed because I think it was not a busy flight. We did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. The canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. We understand BA has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. Our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong was great! We were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. On our way back to London we were excited as we knew we were flying the A380. SQ and Emirates have A380 we have flown. This turned out to be a mistake from the start. When we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. When we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the BA A380 were in comparison to SQ or even Emirates. Next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. The staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. The ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. By the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. No apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles! I was quite upset by now as I had to ask the stewardess what was being served. I have never felt more humiliated. With BA it was just silence. Miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who can't seem to care less with their customers. No smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. Needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched! Our overall flying experience with BA has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable with delicious meals.

Return flight to BKK was a poor experience and Bandaranaike airport was dreadful. Arrived 3 hours before our flight at 1.30am. The airport was packed and chaotic. There was no system at the few and inefficient check in desks open and passengers were very confused. No staff to help or guide people. We queued for 2 hours and checked in with 15 minutes to go before our flight left. No fast track system for people in a hurry and minimal information the very few announcements were too quiet and unintelligible. We managed to get on the plane but it was then delayed for over an hour. It was the middle of the night and people were trying to sleep but as soon as we were airborne the air hostesses went around waking people up to give them a drink and meal. The lights were not dimmed for sleeping. It was a very stressful and tiring experience. We will not fly with this airline again.,Economy,2,3,3,3,2,3,1,2014,0
26749,40407,westjet,R Sawyer,Canada,"I chose the Plus service, partly for the extra leg room and partly because everything is included - no nickel and diming. I have used this before and been reasonably pleased with the benefits, mainly since earlier flights were not full in the Plus section. On these flights however, there wasn't an empty seat on the plane, either way and of course I had a very large ""companion"" in the middle seat. Really it did not feel much different from the regular economy, but at least I did not have to pay any extras. I note that Westjet are going to stop selling the middle seat. Too bad they haven't implemented that already. I was hoping for some level of improved comfort for the extra money, but really I was just crammed in like everyone else. Food is the same as regular economy, and nothing to get excited about: limp sandwiches and junk food snacks. Wine was drinkable. On the return flight, the aircraft had no seat back entertainment, instead they were renting out tablets (much like AC Rouge). This was, of course, free in Plus. Choices on the tablet were minimal. All things considered, this service is preferable to Air Canada, who do not offer a premium economy on this flight. Air Canada do have full Business Class, but at outrageous prices which I cannot charge to my clients.",Premium Economy,6,2,3,2,2,3,7,2015,1

18857,28159,qatar-airways,D Lee,Singapore,Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good. Arrival in Singapore on time and bags were on the belt within 20 minutes. It was a good experience with Qatar Airways and I look forward to flying more of the A350 in future.,Economy,9,4,4,4,5,5,5,2015,1
16919,25194,monarch-airlines,Sweeney Kathryn,United Kingdom,I have just returned from Alicante airport with Monarch. I was a saga passenger in my sixties and needed a wheelchair. Normally we are allowed on first when there is more space and time to get seated with help. I was shocked last night when we had to wait till the end and then face no baggage space and a delay being seated. It was very difficult and painful as I had to wait in a queue on the plane. I will have to consider not booking with Monarch if this should happen again. I hope this was a one off. We had no problem flying out from Manchester. I think the lax attitude of some of the staff was the problem.,Economy,2,2,4,3,0,3,2,2015,0

14563,21205,jet-airways,Saketh Rahm,United States,DEL-HYD-BOM-DEL. Each flight delayed by more than an hour due to 'weather in Delhi' though all other airlines operating on time. Received SMS that the flights were delayed 10 min before boarding which is useless. On board service spotty with the crew more concerned about applying makeup and chatting. You get a tiny cup of water and that's it - have to pay for everything else. Planes have clearly had rows of seats added as there is little to no space between rows. The worst part however was the ground staff. Check in at BOM with rude and uninformed agents who could not checks bag onto ANA codeshare flight to NRT which resulted in a 2 hour ordeal at DEL to get back go through security wait for check in counter to open and recheck bag in again.

From being able to check-in online choose or change our seats online to the overall appearance of the plane to the staff etc it was a great experience. I am vegetarian and they do not cater specifically for us so took some food on board. Our seats were good not quite as much leg room as other airlines but sufficient. Baggage allowance was fantastic. Left and arrived on time. Coming back from SF to NZ was a different story. We had extra luggage so we did a manual check in there were issues with the computer system as it was new. Staff were great. Boarded on time then the Captain announced there were problems after 2 hours on the tarmac we disembarked. Captain kept us well informed. Missed our connecting flights. Once again the staff were great. They re-booked all of us gave us generous food vouchers organised free trolleys for our luggage and had them waiting for us when we went to collect our luggage.

Only slight complaint was although an announcement was made regarding in-flight entertainment and headsets were given out nothing was ever shown. Additionally it was announced that two options were available for the meal one being vegetarian. Once my row was reached there were no more vegetarian meals. The flight attendant was apologetic.

Food was low quality with small portions seat pitch was small as usual and entertainment very reduced. Big black point from cabin crew: I asked for a tooth brush after meal response: no.

The return flight was enjoyable on 24th Sep and proper meals were served with water bottles. The inflight service was good apart from snacks which were served too late. They need to improve dessert. The ticket had allowance for 2 bags but website was showing only 1 bag. There is a lack of communication on the part of airline on baggage issues. The in flight entertainment was enjoyable with a good selection of movies.

Blue Ribbon lounge in BKK offers different drinks and wine cold snacks and some hot food. Possibility to shower. On board there's no real business class. Bangkok Airways created Premiere Class on this route. That means the seats are the same as in economy but the middle seat serves as a small table. Very good food on this short flight. Easy immigration and luggage came fast. Conclusion: very good service. But their economy product is so good that it's difficult to beat it at a reasonable price.

I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.,Economy,2,3,1,2,2,2,1,2015,0

Missed my connecting flight to Singapore and the duty manager at Beijing was rude and wouldn't rebook me on the earliest possible flight (with Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong) because they wouldn't want to rebook me on a non-Air China flight. I was stranded at Beijing Airport for 15 hours and was put on the next available Air China flight to Singapore which left in the afternoon the next day. This flight was again delayed by 3 hours repair works on the left engine of the A330-300 were still ongoing when they called boarding. There was almost no air-conditioning when the plane was waiting for take-off and the captain said there's something wrong with the air conditioning system but the issue won't persist once airborne. Once airborne the in-flight AVOD system crashed constantly and had to be re-booted at least 5 times. I will refrain from flying Air China in the future.,Premium Economy,1,2,3,3,1,1,7,2013,0

The plane was half empty so many people managed to get 3 or 4 seats for themselves (sadly not me) and sleep. The food was great - even for Economy and the selection of inflight movies was ok. The problems started when I had to catch my connecting flight to Auckland - operated by JetStar - and what a difference! Middle of the night flight and no pillow or blanket no seats where one could even attempt to sleep on as they do not have head rests that would keep the head where it is - no food either (unless one pays for it and then it's only sandwiches or crisps) - On my online tickets it says by meals (Qantas) - ""we offer a wide variety of food"" - nothing!

3007,3997,air-france,I Ilieff,United States,TXL-CDG-LAX. Both flights on time CDG-LAX on A380 special meal request honored good IFE clean cabin that was maintained during the flight most staff courteous and helpful. Wheelchair assistance requested for both CDG and LAX upon arrival in CDG none was available so my accompanying passenger had to walk the long distance between CDG Terminals 2F and 2L by herself. Somewhat compensated by security staff letting us use the Priority line for passport control and boarding. CDG-LAX: Usually after the meal service the majority of the cabin staff would go to their rest area and the cabin would be darkened. Well not on Air France. Before disappearing the cabin crew left a few trolleys loaded with snacks and drinks in the aft galley so that area turned into the most popular spot on the plane. My seat was in row 45 immoderately after the galley bulkhead so I was pulled into the bar action. At one time I counted about 25 people crammed into the galley area. There were several groups of 3-4 people each who just hung out for what seemed hours kept drinking alcohol and were becoming louder and louder. As all the lights in the galley were left on and as the curtain was open all the time due to the high passenger traffic the entire aft cabin was brightly illuminated and rendered the otherwise great concept of mood lighting completely useless. The economy class purser arrived shortly thereafter and listened to my complaint and then explained that it was airline policy not to provide beverages and snack runs between the meals as most airlines do but to keep the galley fully opened to the passengers for self-service. The party went on for the next 5 hours until the FA's were back and the second meal/beverage service was started. All in all this was a very unpleasant experience showing the complete lack of effort from the FAs and the pursers to rectify a situation in which a passenger was being inconvenienced. My recommendation: if you want to sleep on the AF 380 stay clear of the aft main deck cabin (rows 45 and up).,Economy,5,5,2,5,5,5,3,2014,0

On the morning of 22nd February we boarded the flight in Dubai at the correct time despite their being some fog in which cleared by approximately 10.30am. We were held on the plane for over 7.5 hours and then had our flight cancelled and were disembarked. Told that once we left the plane an Emirates attendant would be waiting to show us where to go. After we left the plane we went through the airport doors to be offered two options 'arrivals' or 'transfers' and no-one had any idea where to go and no help was available. We saw a few Emirates staff around and when we went to them asking for assistance they just shrugged their shoulders and said we had to queue up at the desk. We queued for 2 hours and when we finally got to the front we were told that no information was available and that we had to come back in 20 minutes! We asked about hotel accommodation and was told that all hotels were booked. The lack of communication was terrible no announcements made no apologies. Finally after an exhaustive night and at about 4am Sunday we were told that everyone would not be able to fly until Monday. This debacle carried on until about 5.30am when we were told that we were going to fly after all at 11am Sunday. The journey took approximately 42 hours which should have been a four hour flight.
